The Global Economy in a Sticky Spot

2024 Global growth is projected to be in line with the April 2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast, at 3.2
percent in 2024 and 3.3 percent in 2025. However, varied momentum in activity at the turn of the year has somewhat
narrowed the output divergence across economies as cyclical factors wane and activity becomes better aligned with its
potential. Services price inflation is holding up progress on disinflation, which is complicating monetary policy
normalization. Upside risks to inflation have thus increased, raising the prospect of higher-for-even-longer interest rates,
in the context of escalating trade tensions and increased policy uncertainty. To manage these risks and preserve growth,
the policy mix should be sequenced carefully to achieve price stability and replenish diminished buffers.
Global activity and world trade firmed up at the turn of the year, with trade spurred by strong exports
from Asia, particularly in the technology sector. Relative to the April 2024 WEO, first quarter growth
surprised on the upside in many countries, although downside surprises in Japan and the United
States were notable. In the United States, after a sustained period of strong outperformance, a
sharper-than-expected slowdown in growth reflected moderating consumption and a negative
contribution from net trade. In Japan, the negative growth surprise stemmed from temporary supply
disruptions linked to the shutdown of a major automobile plant in the first quarter. In contrast,
shoots of economic recovery materialized in Europe, led by an improvement in services activity. In
China, resurgent domestic consumption propelled the positive upside in the first quarter, aided by
what looked to be a temporary surge in exports belatedly reconnecting with last year’s rise in global
demand. These developments have narrowed the output divergences somewhat across economies, as
cyclical factors wane and activity becomes better aligned with its potential.

number of central banks in emerging market economies remain cautious in regard to cutting rates
owing to external risks triggered by changes in interest rate differentials and associated depreciation
of those economies’ currencies against the dollar.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2024

Global financial conditions remain accommodative. Although longer-term yields have generally drifted
upward, in tandem with the repricing of policy paths, buoyant corporate valuations have kept
financial conditions accommodative, broadly at the level of the April WEO (see Box 1). The increase
in yields is likely to put pressure on fiscal discipline, however, which in some countries is already
strained by the inability to rein in spending or raise taxes.
A Waxing and Waning Outlook
IMF staff projections are based on upward revisions to commodity prices, including a rise in nonfuel
prices by 5 percent in 2024. Energy commodity prices are expected to fall by about 4.6 percent in
2024, less than projected in the April WEO, reflecting elevated oil prices from deep cuts by OPEC+
(the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC oil
exporters) and reduced, but still present, price pressure from the Middle East conflict. Monetary
policy rates of major central banks are still expected to decline in the second half of 2024, with
divergence in the pace of normalization reflecting varied inflation circumstances.
Growth is expected to remain stable. At 3.2 percent in 2024 and 3.3 percent in 2025, the forecast for global
economic growth is broadly unchanged from that in April (Table 1). Under the hood, however,
offsetting growth revisions have shifted the composition.
Among advanced economies, growth is expected to
converge over the coming quarters (Figure 2).
In the United States, projected growth is revised
downward to 2.6 percent in 2024 (0.1
percentage point lower than projected in April),
reflecting the slower-than-expected start to the
year. Growth is expected to slow to 1.9 percent
in 2025 as the labor market cools and
consumption moderates, with fiscal policy
starting to tighten gradually. By the end of 2025,
growth is projected to taper to potential, closing
the positive output gap.

expected for 2024 (an upward revision of 0.1
percentage point), driven by stronger momentum in services and higher-than-expected net exports in
the first half of the year; growth is projected to rise to 1.5 percent in 2025. This is underpinned by
stronger consumption on the back of rising real wages, as well as higher investment from easing
financing conditions amid gradual monetary policy loosening this year. Continued weaknesses in
manufacturing suggest a more sluggish recovery in countries such as Germany.

In Japan, the strong shunto wage settlement is expected to support a turnaround in private
consumption starting in the second half. But the expectation for 2024 growth is revised downward by
0.2 percentage point, with the downward adjustment largely reflecting temporary supply disruptions
and weak private investment in the first quarter.
The forecast for growth in emerging market and developing economies is revised upward; the projected
increase is powered by stronger activity in Asia, particularly China and India. For China, the growth
2

International Monetary Fund | July 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2024

forecast is revised upward to 5 percent in 2024, primarily on account of a rebound in private
consumption and strong exports in the first quarter. In 2025, GDP is projected to slow to 4.5
percent, and to continue to decelerate over the medium term to 3.3 percent by 2029, because of
headwinds from aging and slowing productivity growth. The forecast for growth in India has also
been revised upward, to 7.0 percent, this year, with the change reflecting carryover from upward
revisions to growth in 2023 and improved prospects for private consumption, particularly in rural
areas.
With regard to Latin America and the Caribbean, growth has been revised downward for 2024 in Brazil,
reflecting the near-term impact of flooding, and in Mexico, due to moderation in demand. However,
growth has been revised upwards in 2025 for Brazil to reflect reconstruction following the floods and
supportive structural factors (for example, acceleration in hydrocarbon production). For the Middle
East and Central Asia, oil production and regional conflicts continue to weigh on prospects. The
growth forecast for 2024 in Saudi Arabia has been revised downward by 0.9 percentage point; the
adjustment reflects mainly the extension of oil production cuts. Projected growth in Sudan is revised
markedly downward, as persisting conflict takes a larger toll on the economy. The forecast for growth
in sub-Saharan Africa is revised downward, mainly as a result of a 0.2 percentage point downward
revision to the growth outlook in Nigeria amid weaker than expected activity in the first quarter of this
year.
Trade makes a recovery. World trade growth is expected to recover to about 3¼ percent annually in
2024–25 (from quasi stagnation in 2023) and align with global GDP growth again. The uptick in the
first quarter of this year is expected to moderate as manufacturing remains subdued. Although crossborder trade restrictions have surged, harming trade between geopolitically distant blocs, the global
trade-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain stable in the projection.
Global inflation will continue to decline. In advanced economies, the revised forecast is for the pace of
disinflation to slow in 2024 and 2025. That is because inflation in prices for services is now expected
to be more persistent and commodity prices higher. However, the gradual cooling of labor markets,
together with an expected decline in energy prices, should bring headline inflation back to target by
the end of 2025. Inflation is expected to remain higher in emerging market and developing economies
(and to drop more slowly) than in advanced economies. However, partly thanks to falling energy
prices, inflation is already close to prepandemic levels for the median emerging market and
developing economy.
Not Yet in the Clear
Overall, risks to the outlook remain balanced, as in the April 2024 WEO, but some near-term risks
have gained prominence. These include upside risks to inflation that stem from a lack of progress on
services disinflation and price pressures emanating from renewed trade or geopolitical tensions. Risks
of persistent inflation in the services sector are tied to both wage and price setting, given that labor
accounts for a high share of the costs in that sector. Higher nominal wage growth, which in some
cases reflects the catch-up of real wages, if accompanied by weak productivity, could make it difficult
for firms to moderate price increases, especially when profit margins are already squeezed. This could
lead to further stickiness in wage and price inflation. The escalation of trade tensions could further
raise near-term risks to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods along the supply chain.
Bumpiness along the remaining disinflation path could destabilize the return to price stability if shortterm expectations spike upward as a result of disappointing inflation data.
International Monetary Fund | July 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2024

The risk of elevated inflation has raised the prospects of higher-for-even-longer interest rates, which in
turn increases external, fiscal, and financial risks. Prolonged dollar appreciation arising from rate
disparities could disrupt capital flows and impede planned monetary policy easing, which could
adversely impact growth. Persistently high interest rates could raise borrowing costs further and affect
financial stability if fiscal improvements do not offset higher real rates amid lower potential growth
(see IMF Blog).
The potential for significant swings in economic policy as a result of elections this year, with negative
spillovers to the rest of the world, has increased the uncertainty around the baseline. These potential
shifts entail fiscal profligacy risks that will worsen debt dynamics, adversely affecting long-term yields
and ratcheting up protectionism. Trade tariffs, alongside a scaling up of industrial policies worldwide,
can generate damaging cross‐border spillovers, as well as trigger retaliation, resulting in a costly race
to the bottom. By contrast, policies that promote multilateralism and a faster implementation of
macrostructural reforms could boost supply gains, productivity, and growth, with positive spillovers
worldwide.
Future-Proofing the Economy
As output gaps start to close and inflation recedes, policymakers face two tasks: persevering with
restoring price stability and addressing the legacies of recent crises, including replenishing lost buffers
and durably uplifting growth. In the near term, this will require careful calibration and sequencing of
the policy mix. In countries where upside risks to inflation—including those arising through external
channels—have materialized, central banks should refrain from easing too early and remain open to
further tightening should it become necessary. Where inflation data encouragingly signal a durable
return to price stability, monetary policy easing should proceed gradually, which would
simultaneously provide room for the required fiscal consolidation to take place. Fiscal slippages over
the past year in some countries could require a stance significantly tighter than envisaged. As the
space for fiscal maneuver narrows, commitments to achieving fiscal consolidation targets should be
earnestly adhered to, aided by sound fiscal frameworks and resource mobilization (see Chapter 1 of
the April 2024 Fiscal Monitor).
In emerging market and developing economies, recent policy divergences highlight the need to
manage the risks of currency and capital flow volatility. Given that economic fundamentals remain
the main factor in dollar appreciation, the appropriate response is to allow the exchange rate to
adjust, while using monetary policy to keep inflation close to target. Foreign reserves should be used
prudently and preserved to deal with potentially worse outflows in the future, in line with the IMF’s
Integrated Policy Framework. To the extent possible, macroprudential policies should mitigate
vulnerabilities from large exposures to foreign-currency-denominated debt.
Near-term challenges aside, policymakers must act now to revitalize declining medium-term growth
prospects. Striking differences in productivity trends across countries since the pandemic suggest that
not all factors are cyclical and that decisive policy action is needed to enhance business dynamism and
reduce resource misallocation to arrest weaknesses (see Chapter 3 of the April 2024 WEO). Further
boosting labor supply, especially by better integrating women and immigrants—key segments
contributing to economic resilience in advanced economies—will mitigate demographic pressures,
adding to potential growth gains. While emigration of the young and educated population can take a
toll on source countries, the costs can be mitigated. Policies that help leverage diaspora networks,
maximize the benefits from remittances, and expand domestic labor market opportunities are
4

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2024

possible avenues (see Chapter 4 of the October 2016 WEO).
Finally, the misuse of inward and domestically oriented policies compromises the ability to tackle
global challenges—such as climate change—in regard to which multilateral cooperation and trade are
vital. These policies are also often inadequate to address domestic issues, as they increase fiscal
pressures and risk further distortions such as resource misallocation. All countries should thus scale
back on use of trade-distorting measures and strive instead to strengthen the multilateral trading
system.

US real rates—measured by the level of the real risk premium —

of the exchange rate for the US dollar against major advanced economy currencies since April. The Japanese yen
has seen sustained depreciation pressures against the dollar over this period, characterized by excessive moves in
the currency and subsequent market interventions by the authorities.
Emerging market economies have been resilient overall, although the performance of emerging market
currencies has varied some. Broadly speaking, emerging market currencies have been subject to depreciation
pressures.3 Furthermore, emerging markets have experienced net capital outflows4 since April, while showing
some sensitivity to changes in expectations for the US policy path. Even as international sovereign bond issuance
has slowed, a few frontier markets have been prefinancing redemptions due in the next quarter despite elevated
financing costs to mitigate the much-anticipated refinancing risk.

Overall, buoyant corporate valuations have kept financial
conditions accommodative (Figure 1.2). However, a slower pace
of policy easing in the US and other advanced economies, amid
continued uncertainty around the global economic outlook, could
exacerbate financial market volatility and challenge these valuations.
In addition, emerging market currencies may come under further
pressure with narrowing of interest rate differentials against the US.

Risk assets have appreciated from elevated levels of the first
quarter, driven in part by resilient corporates. Solid corporate
profits have driven valuations in US and euro area equities higher, as
companies in most sectors have posted upside earnings surprises.
Equity valuations in major emerging markets have been mixed,
while corporate spreads continue to remain tight across most
regions.
