WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE
Global Economy: Tenuous Resilience amid Persistent Uncertainty
Global growth is projected at 3.0 percent for 2025 and 3.1 percent in 2026. The forecast for 2025 is 0.2
percentage point higher than that in the reference forecast of the April 2025 World Economic Outlook
(WEO) and 0.1 percentage point higher for 2026. This reflects stronger-than-expected front-loading in
anticipation of higher tariffs; lower average effective US tariff rates than announced in April; an improvement in
financial conditions, including due to a weaker US dollar; and fiscal expansion in some major jurisdictions.
Global headline inflation is expected to fall to 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026, a path similar to
the one projected in April. The overall picture hides notable cross-country differences, with forecasts predicting
inflation will remain above target in the United States and be more subdued in other large economies.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, as they were in the April 2025 WEO. A rebound in effective
tariff rates could lead to weaker growth. Elevated uncertainty could start weighing more heavily on activity, also as
deadlines for additional tariffs expire without progress on substantial, permanent agreements. Geopolitical tensions
could disrupt global supply chains and push commodity prices up. Larger fiscal deficits or increased risk aversion
could raise long-term interest rates and tighten global financial conditions. Combined with fragmentation concerns,
this could reignite volatility in financial markets. On the upside, global growth could be lifted if trade negotiations
lead to a predictable framework and to a decline in tariffs. Policies need to bring confidence, predictability, and
sustainability by calming tensions, preserving price and financial stability, restoring fiscal buffers, and
implementing much-needed structural reforms.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Global financial conditions have eased (Box 1). US equity markets have largely rebounded, erasing
losses from the April 2 tariff fallout and reaching new heights. Other global equity markets have
also rallied, swayed by tariff-related announcements and releases of macroeconomic data that
turned out to be better than expected. Notably, the US dollar has depreciated further, defying
expectations that tariffs and larger fiscal deficits would cause the currency to appreciate. Implied
paths for policy rates have flattened for advanced economies, while continued dollar weakness
has provided some monetary policy space for emerging market and developing economies. Yield
curves have steepened in the context of fiscal concerns, although the steepening thus far is not
unusual by historical standards despite very high debt and deficit levels in many countries.
With these forces in place, the global economy has continued to hold steady, but the
composition of activity points to distortions from tariffs, rather than underlying robustness.
Global growth in the first quarter of 2025 was 0.3 percentage point above that predicted in the
April WEO. International trade and investment drove activity, while private consumption was
more subdued across major jurisdictions. Real GDP decreased in the United States, at an
annualized rate of 0.5 percent, marking the first quarterly contraction in three years. Consumer
spending rose only by 0.5 percent, but this came after remarkably fast growth of 4.0 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2024. Imports and business investment surged—especially in information
processing equipment. Taken together, these patterns were consistent with aggressive frontloading by US firms and households ahead of expected higher prices induced by tariffs. In the
euro area, GDP accelerated to 2.5 percent, driven by investment and net exports, even as private
consumption lost steam. Ireland largely led the spurt, with growth shrinking to 1.4 percent when
Ireland is excluded. China’s real GDP growth, at an annualized rate of 6.0 percent, exceeded
expectations. This was mainly driven by exports, propped up by a depreciating renminbi closely
tracking the dollar and with declining sales to the United States more than offset by strong sales
to the rest of the world (Figure 2), and, to a smaller extent, by consumption, supported by fiscal
measures. Japan’s economy contracted by an annualized 0.2 percent, as soft private consumption
and weak net exports weighed on growth while strong private investment helped cushion the
decline. Global trade grew robustly in the first

Global inflation is showing mixed signs. The
global median of sequential headline inflation
has increased a notch, but core inflation has
eased considerably and is now below 2 percent.
Several economies, including the euro area,
have seen downside surprises. In the United
States, inflation has ticked up, with tentative
signs of pass-through from tariffs and a weaker
dollar to consumer prices in some importsensitive categories, and intermediate goods
costs for producers have risen.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2025

Crosscurrents Blur the Outlook
IMF staff projections in this update are based on real-time current trade policy; that is, they
assume that policies as they stand at the time of writing are permanent. This is the case even
regarding measures that have been framed as temporary or pending, meaning that pauses on
higher tariffs are assumed to remain in place past their expiration dates and higher rates are
assumed not to take effect. The US effective tariff rate underlying the projections is 17.3
percent, compared with 24.4 percent in the April reference forecast. The corresponding effective
tariff rate for the rest of the world is 3.5 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in the April
reference forecast. Economic policy uncertainty is assumed to remain elevated this year and
next. Prices for energy commodities are expected to fall by about 7 percent in 2025, less than
projected in the April WEO. Oil prices increased materially during military strikes between the
Islamic Republic of Iran and Israel in June, with the increase primarily reflecting higher risk
premiums, because the physical supply of oil was not disrupted. This geopolitics-induced
increase has now largely receded, and bearish fundamentals are back in focus, with strong supply
from both inside OPEC+ (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected
nonmember countries, including Russia) and sources outside of OPEC+ outpacing tepid growth
in demand. Prices for natural gas have remained relatively contained amid expectations of lower
energy demand resulting from trade uncertainty, news of European Union plans for more
flexible targets in regard to storage filling, and the prospects of ample increases in liquid natural
gas supply in the medium term. Monetary policy rates in the United Kingdom and the United
States are expected to decline in the second half of 2025, though at varying speeds, whereas the
IMF staff expects the policy rate in the euro area to remain unchanged and that in Japan to rise
gradually. Fiscal stimulus is anticipated in major economies in the near term, including China,
Germany, and the United States. In the United States, the OBBBA is expected to increase the
fiscal deficit by about 1.5 percentage points of GDP in 2026, with tariff revenues offsetting
about half of this increase. In the medium term, despite back-loaded spending cuts and sizable
tariff revenues, US fiscal deficits are projected to be larger than they were in the April WEO.
Global growth is expected to decelerate, with
apparent resilience due to trade-related
distortions waning. At 3.0 percent in 2025
and 3.1 percent in 2026, the forecasts are
below the 2024 outcome of 3.3 percent and
the prepandemic historical average of 3.7
percent, even though they are higher than
the April reference forecast (Table 1; see also
Annex Table 1). The upward revision for
2025 is quite broad based (Figure 3), because
it owes in large part to strong front-loading
in international trade as well as to a lower
worldwide effective tariff rate than assumed
in the April reference forecast and to an
improvement in global financial conditions.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Still, the revision is more pronounced in some countries, such as China, than in others. Frontloading is expected to unwind in the coming quarters, with the payback weighing on activity in
2026 but offset by other developments, so growth overall is revised slightly upward.
Growth in advanced economies is projected to be 1.5 percent in 2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026. In the
United States, with tariff rates settling at lower levels than those announced on April 2 and looser
financial conditions, the economy is projected to expand at a rate of 1.9 percent in 2025. This is
0.1 percentage point higher than the April reference forecast, with some offset from private
demand cooling faster than expected and weaker immigration. Growth is projected to pick up
slightly to 2.0 percent in 2026, with a near-term boost from the OBBBA kicking in primarily
through tax incentives for corporate investment. This is 0.3 percentage point higher than the
April reference forecast. The IMF staff estimates that the OBBBA could raise US output by
about 0.5 percent on average over the WEO horizon through 2030, relative to a baseline without
this fiscal package.
In the euro area, growth is expected to accelerate to 1.0 percent in 2025 and to 1.2 percent in
2026. This is an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2025, but it is largely driven by the
strong GDP outturn in Ireland in the first quarter of the year, although Ireland represents less
than 5 percent of euro area GDP. The upward revision for 2025 reflects a historically large
increase in Irish pharmaceutical exports to the United States resulting from front-loading and
the opening of new production facilities. Without Ireland, the revision would be only 0.1
percentage point. The forecast for 2026 is unchanged from that in April, with the effects of
front-loading fading and the economy growing at potential. Revised defense spending
commitments are expected to have an impact in subsequent years, given the projected gradual
increase to target levels by 2035.
In other advanced economies, growth is projected to decelerate to 1.6 percent in 2025 and pick up to
2.1 percent in 2026. In some cases, currency appreciation offsets the favorable effects of more
accommodative financial conditions, while the effective tariff rates are the same or slightly
higher than in the April WEO reference forecast because of new tariffs imposed on imports of
vehicle parts in May and a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum in June.
In emerging market and developing economies, growth is expected to be 4.1 percent in 2025 and 4.0
percent in 2026. Relative to the forecast in April, growth in 2025 for China is revised upward by
0.8 percentage point to 4.8 percent. This revision reflects stronger-than-expected activity in the
first half of 2025 and the significant reduction in US–China tariffs. The GDP outturn in the first
quarter of 2025 alone implies a mechanical upgrade to the growth rate for the year of 0.6
percentage point. A recovery in inventory accumulation is expected to partly offset payback
from front-loading in the second half of 2025. Growth in 2026 is also revised upward by 0.2
percentage point to 4.2 percent, again reflecting the lower effective tariff rates. In India, growth is
projected to be 6.4 percent in 2025 and 2026, with both numbers revised slightly upward,
reflecting a more benign external environment than assumed in the April reference forecast.
In the Middle East and Central Asia, growth is projected to accelerate to 3.4 percent in 2025 and
3.5 percent in 2026. Growth is expected to be relatively stable in 2025 in sub-Saharan Africa at 4.0
percent, before picking up to 4.3 percent in 2026. In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is

International Monetary Fund | July 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2025

projected to slow to 2.2 percent in 2025 and recover back to 2.4 percent in 2026. Growth in
emerging and developing Europe is also expected to slow and remain sluggish at 1.8 percent in 2025
and 2.2 percent in 2026.
World trade volume is revised upward by 0.9 percentage point for 2025 and downward by 0.6
percentage point for 2026. The near-term offset provided by front-loading of some trade flows
in view of elevated trade policy uncertainty and in anticipation of tighter trade restrictions is
expected to fade in the second half of 2025, with the associated payback expected to materialize
through 2026. A weaker dollar amplifies the tariff shock instead of absorbing it, leading to a
positive impact of tariffs on the US current account balance, which the expansionary fiscal
stance more than offsets. Over the medium term, expansionary fiscal packages in economies
with current account surpluses are expected to contribute to declining global imbalances.
Global inflation is expected to continue to decline, with headline inflation falling to 4.2 percent in
2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026. This is virtually unchanged from the April WEO, with trends of
cooling demand and falling energy prices remaining in place. The overall picture hides crosscountry variation in forecasts, however. The tariffs, acting as a supply shock, are expected to
pass through to US consumer prices gradually and hit inflation in the second half of 2025.
Elsewhere, the tariffs constitute a negative demand shock, lowering inflationary pressures.
Inflation is projected to remain above the 2 percent target through 2026 in the United States,
whereas in the euro area inflationary dynamics are expected to be more subdued, in part on
account of currency appreciation and one-off fiscal measures. Although headline inflation in
China is projected to remain broadly unchanged from the forecast in April because domestic
energy prices have been lower than forecast then, core inflation is revised upward slightly to 0.5
percent in 2025 and to 0.8 percent in 2026. These revisions reflect recent higher-than-expected
readings and the reduced tariffs.

Risks on a Hazy Horizon
Overall, risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, as in the April WEO.
The precarious equilibrium of trade policy stances assumed in the baseline could be disturbed.
The new equilibrium could be one with tariff rates similar to those today, or it could be one in
which rates are much higher, negotiations break down, and an escalation of protectionist
measures restarts. Resetting tariff rates to the levels of April 2 or higher (as mentioned in the US
administration’s letters to trade partners) on August 1 and implementing tariffs as high as 50
percent on copper as currently pronounced would dampen global growth. By way of illustration,
staff simulations suggest that global growth in 2025 would be roughly 0.2 percentage point lower
if the maximum of April-2 tariff rates and tariff rates in the letters sent up to July 14 were to be
implemented. Imposition of additional sectoral tariffs in areas such as electronics and
pharmaceuticals could raise effective tariff rates and create bottlenecks that amplify the direct
effect of higher tariffs. Nontariff measures targeting critical inputs could lead to dislocations in
global supply chains. In the presence of strategic complementarities whereby price hikes by one
firm increase the incentive for other firms to take similar action, the potential inflationary impact
of additional tariffs and nontariff measures could prove to be significant and persistent. Even if
tariff rates do not change relative to what is assumed in the baseline and no new protectionist
International Monetary Fund | July 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

measures are introduced, elevated trade policy uncertainty could start weighing more heavily on
activity, as the current US deadlines for additional measures to take effect expire without lasting,
comprehensive agreements. Firms’ investments in existing and new trade linkages may be
affected, thus slowing down growth in trade and output, especially in export-oriented
economies.
An escalation of geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East or Ukraine, could
introduce new negative supply shocks to the global economy. Shipping routes and supply chains
may be disrupted while commodity prices rise, especially if, unlike what happened in June,
supply infrastructure were to be damaged. These forces would lower growth and reignite
inflationary pressures. Central banks could face more difficult trade-offs when they are already
grappling with challenges from the trade environment.
Fiscal vulnerabilities could become more salient, with implications for financial markets and
spillovers to the real economy. A number of economies, including Brazil, France, and the United
States, are projected to run large fiscal deficits against the backdrop of historically high levels of
public debt. This could raise term premiums and, especially in the case of the United States,
tighten global financial conditions. An increase in US term premiums led by concerns regarding
fiscal sustainability could also make financial markets excessively volatile, especially if it interacts
with concerns about geoeconomic fragmentation and the future of the international monetary
system centered on the dollar (see the 2025 External Sector Report).
Front-loading has shaped economic activity in the first half of the year, creating exposures that
could amplify the impact of any potential negative shocks. For instance, a possible inventory
overhang could reduce import orders more than projected. Firms may be burdened with
increased holding costs and potential losses from obsolescence, especially if demand for
stockpiled goods does not materialize or financial conditions tighten.
On the upside, a breakthrough in trade negotiations establishing a predictable framework could
lead to a further decline in effective tariff rates and other protectionist measures. By
meaningfully bringing down uncertainty and fostering policy predictability, nondiscriminatory
agreements to reduce trade barriers could facilitate investment and other business decisions.
Their impact could be larger if, besides goods trade, they cover trade in digital services and
foreign investment. In the longer term, benefits would accrue in the form of faster productivity
growth and enhanced resilience to external shocks.
A new wave of credible trade agreements could usher in a broader reform momentum to lift
medium-term growth. Progress on labor market policies for upskilling and a reduction of
barriers to mobility, simplification of business regulations, and measures to enhance competition
and innovation could become inevitable in a more challenging global economic environment.

Policies to Restore Confidence and Ensure Sustainability
Countries should reduce policy-induced uncertainty by promoting clear and transparent trade
frameworks. Pragmatic cooperation is paramount in instances in which some rules of the
international trading system, in their current form, may not be functioning as intended. This
entails the pursuit of multilateral initiatives on the global commons and modernizing trade rules

6

International Monetary Fund | July 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK UPDATE, JULY 2025

where feasible while seeking plurilateral or regional solutions on other matters. Bilateral
negotiations can help defuse trade tensions and should aim to reduce trade and investment
barriers while not increasing them toward third parties, which could escalate tensions with other
trading partners. Such negotiations should be pursued with the ultimate aim of addressing the
root causes of tensions: specifically, excess external imbalances arising from internal policy
choices (see the 2025 External Sector Report). This would involve identifying and taking steps to
resolve the underlying distortions for a more durable solution. Broad subsidies and industrial
policies aiming to protect exports can be costly and distortive. To minimize the risk of
misallocation amid limited fiscal space, industrial policies should be targeted narrowly to resolve
specific, well-identified externalities and market failures. Adopting a pragmatic cooperative
approach to these policies could reduce negative spillovers among trading partners. More
generally, international cooperation across various policy areas, including trade, industrial
policies, and taxation, can mitigate cross-country spillovers and support vulnerable economies.
Restoring fiscal space and ensuring sustainable public debt is crucial, even while addressing
critical spending needs. This requires credible medium-term fiscal consolidation with growthfriendly adjustments and a focus on rebuilding buffers. Countries should enhance fiscal
revenues, improve spending efficiency, crowd in private sector investment, and use automatic
stabilizers for negative demand shocks. Any new discretionary measures should be well targeted
at those severely affected by trade disruptions and should be temporary with clear sunset clauses.
Spending cuts elsewhere or new revenues should offset such measures, especially in countries
with limited fiscal space.
Central banks must carefully calibrate monetary policies to country-specific circumstances to
maintain price and financial stability amid prolonged trade tensions and evolving tariffs. In
countries imposing tariffs on trading partners—either by initiating or by retaliating—these
actions constitute supply shocks. Hence, central banks in these countries face a difficult trade-off
between shielding the real sector and preventing the expected one-off increase in prices from
turning into persistently higher inflation. The trade-off becomes more pertinent if inflation is
already above target. Further easing of monetary policy should then depend on having
convincing evidence that inflation and inflation expectations are heading decisively back to
target. Countries that have not imposed tariffs, by contrast, face a demand shock. Central banks
could, in this case, gradually reduce the policy rate.
The differing economic impact of tariffs across countries could complicate the trade-offs by
introducing a divergence in monetary policy stances. Under normal circumstances, exchange
rates should be allowed to adjust. The IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework provides guidance
tailored to country-specific conditions on appropriate policy responses if disruptive movements
in foreign exchange and risk premiums take hold. In some cases under such circumstances, at
the same time as upholding appropriate monetary and fiscal policies, it may be suitable to
implement temporary foreign exchange interventions or capital flow management measures.
In both tariffing and tariffed countries, elevated uncertainty and volatility require robust
prudential policies to safeguard financial stability. Crucially, the ambiguous and volatile
landscape also requires clear and consistent messaging from central banks and the protection of
central bank independence, not only in legal terms, but also in practice.

Amid continued elevated levels of uncertainty, more prominent use of scenario analysis can
support macroeconomic policymaking. Contingency plans for different types of risks should be
ready to be activated should any of those risks be realized.
Ultimately, lifting medium-term growth prospects is the only sustainable way to ease
macroeconomic trade-offs. Enduring structural reforms in areas such as labor markets,
education, regulation, and competition can boost productivity, potential growth, and job
creation. In addition, measures fostering technological advancements, including digitalization
and the adoption of artificial intelligence, can further enhance productivity and potential growth.

Box 1. GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY
UPDATE
Box
1. GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY UPDATE
uUPDATE
Global financial conditions have eased since the April
Global Financial Stability Report, reverting toward
accommodative conditions by historical standards (Figure
1.1, panel 1). Equity valuations have returned to lofty levels, and
corporate credit spreads have tightened to the lows attained at
the beginning of the year, whereas market volatility has declined,
despite still-elevated uncertainty regarding trade policy. Market
participants remain attentive to any lagged impact from tariffs
on economic data, which so far remain largely resilient. A
rebound of tariffs to meaningfully higher levels following the
end of the pauses in effect could weigh on market sentiment,
potentially triggering again a sharp repricing in risk assets.
Monetary policy paths in major advanced economies are
expected to be shallower compared with what was
expected in April and remain uneven across countries
reflecting different stages of cycles amid varying paces of disinflation. Market pricing implies the
European Central Bank, after having cut sequentially, may cut rates once more this year before ending its
current easing cycle, and that the Federal Reserve and Bank of England will continue easing, with each
cutting rates around twice more this year after pausing to assess incoming data. Japan remains an outlier,
with markets pricing in a modest, though declining, likelihood of another rate hike this year.
Sovereign yield curves for major advanced economies have
steepened since April as bond issuance has continued to
rise. This has coincided with widening fiscal deficits and reduced
demand for duration by liability-driven investors as well as
quantitative tightening, pushing up longer-term yields (Figure 1.1,
panel 2). Despite bouts of upward yield pressures in advanced
economies, local currency yields in emerging markets have
generally declined, aided by a weaker dollar.
The US dollar has weakened considerably since April,
although yields in the United States are higher than those in other
advanced economies such as the euro area (Figure 1.2, panel 1).
Some investors point out structural factors driving dollar
depreciation, including shifts away from US securities, though
current data on cross-border capital flows does not suggest a broad-based pullback. Increased hedging
against dollar weakness resulting from investor concerns about changes in the historical hedging properties
of the dollar has contributed to its depreciation in part. However, whether such a switch in the currencies’
perceived risk-hedging properties is temporary or proves longer-lasting remains uncertain at this juncture.
Meanwhile, many emerging market currencies have appreciated (Figure 1.2, panel 2), and capital inflows
have resumed since April, with investors seeing space for some emerging market central banks to ease.
This box was prepared by the Monetary and Capital Markets Department’s Global Markets Analysis division. It provides an update on market
developments since the April 2025 Global Financial Stability Report.
