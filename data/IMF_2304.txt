ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during
February 15, 2023, to March 15, 2023, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange
rate mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies
for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $73.13 a barrel
in 2023 and $68.90 a barrel in 2024; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States will average
5.1 percent in 2023 and 4.5 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average 2.8 percent in 2023 and 3.0
percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average –0.1 percent in 2023 and 0.0 percent in 2024; and that the
10-year government bond yield for the United States will average 3.8 percent in 2023 and 3.6 percent in 2024,
that for the euro area will average 2.5 percent in 2023 and 2.8 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average 0.6 percent in 2023 and 2024. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The
estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through March 28, 2023.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
• . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
• – between years or months (for example, 2022–23 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
• /

between years or months (for example, 2022/23) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

• “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
• “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
• Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
• For some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the
national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Beginning with the April 2023 WEO, ASEAN-5 comprises the five ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) founding member nations: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
• On January 1, 2023, Croatia became the 20th country to join the euro area. Data for Croatia are now included
in aggregates for the euro area and for advanced economies and relevant subgroups.
• For Ecuador, fiscal sector projections are excluded from publication for 2023–28 because of ongoing program
discussions.
In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• Tables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw
on data from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A ROCKY RECOVERY

• Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
• The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of
the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series most
frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context
of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each
country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural
breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF
staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a
result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but these cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a
concerted effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are
incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF
website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of PierreOlivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya Koeva
Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, Research Department. Shekhar
Aiyar, Division Chief, Research Department, and Head of the Spillovers Task Force, supervised Chapter 4.

The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments, as
well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on March 30, 2023. However, estimates,
projections, and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive
Directors or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

It Was Never Going to Be an Easy Ride
On the surface, the global economy appears poised
for a gradual recovery from the powerful blows of the
pandemic and of Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine.
China is rebounding strongly following the reopening
of its economy. Supply-chain disruptions are unwinding, while the dislocations to energy and food markets
caused by the war are receding. Simultaneously, the
massive and synchronous tightening of monetary
policy by most central banks should start to bear fruit,
with inflation moving back toward its targets.
In our latest forecast, global growth will bottom
out at 2.8 percent this year before rising modestly to
3.0 percent in 2024. Global inflation will decrease,
although more slowly than initially anticipated, from
8.7 percent in 2022 to 7.0 percent this year and 4.9
percent in 2024.
Notably, emerging market and developing economies are already powering ahead in many cases, with
growth rates (fourth quarter over fourth quarter)
jumping from 2.8 percent in 2022 to 4.5 percent
this year. The slowdown is concentrated in advanced
economies, especially the euro area and the United
Kingdom, where growth (also fourth quarter over
fourth quarter) is expected to fall to 0.7 percent and
–0.4 percent, respectively, this year before rebounding
to 1.8 and 2.0 percent in 2024.
Below the surface, however, turbulence is building,
and the situation is quite fragile, as the recent bout of
banking instability reminded us.
Inflation is much stickier than anticipated even a
few months ago. While global inflation has declined,
that reflects mostly the sharp reversal in energy and
food prices. But core inflation, excluding the volatile
energy and food components, has not yet peaked
in many countries. It is expected to decline to 5.1
percent this year (fourth quarter over fourth quarter),
a sizable upward revision of 0.6 percentage point from
our January update, well above target.
Activity too shows signs of resilience as labor markets remain historically tight in most advanced economies. At this point in the tightening cycle, we would

xiv

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

expect to see stronger signs of output and employment softening. Instead, both output and inflation
estimates have been revised upward for the past two
quarters, suggesting stronger-than-expected demand,
which may require monetary policy to tighten further
or to stay tighter for longer.
Should we worry about the risk of an uncontrolled
wage-price spiral? At this point, I remain unconvinced. Nominal wage inflation continues to lag far
behind price inflation, implying a steep and unprecedented decline in real wages. Given the tightness in
labor markets, this is unlikely to continue, and real
wages should recover. Corporate margins have surged
in recent years—this is the flip side of steeply higher
prices but only modestly higher wages—and should
be able to absorb rising labor costs on average. As long
as inflation expectations remain well anchored, that
process should not spin out of control. It may well,
however, take some time.
More worrisome is that the sharp policy tightening
of the past 12 months is starting to have serious side
effects for the financial sector, as we have repeatedly
warned might happen (October 2022 Global Financial
Stability Report; January 2023 World Economic Outlook
[WEO] Update). Following a prolonged period of
muted inflation and extremely low interest rates, last
year’s rapid tightening of monetary policy has triggered sizable losses on long-term fixed-income assets.
The stability of any financial system hinges on its
ability to absorb losses without recourse to taxpayers’ money. The financial instability last fall in the
gilt market in the United Kingdom and the recent
banking turbulence in the United States with the collapse of a few regional banks illustrate that significant
vulnerabilities exist both among banks and nonbank
financial institutions. In both cases the authorities
took quick and strong action and have been able to
contain the spread of the crisis so far (April 2023
Global Financial Stability Report). Yet the financial
system may well be tested again.
Once again, downside risks dominate. Nervous
investors often look for the next weakest link, as
they did with Credit Suisse, a globally systemic but

FOREWORD

ailing European bank. Financial institutions with
excess leverage, credit risk or interest rate exposure,
too much dependence on short-term funding, or
located in jurisdictions with limited fiscal space could
become the next target. So could countries with
weaker perceived fundamentals. A sharp tightening
of global financial conditions—a “‘risk-off” shock—
could have a dramatic impact on credit conditions
and public finances especially in emerging market and
developing economies, with large capital outflows, a
sudden increase in risk premia, a dollar appreciation
in a rush toward safety, and major declines in global
activity amid lower confidence, household spending,
and investment. In such a severe downside scenario,
global GDP per capita could come close to falling—
an outcome whose probability we estimate at about
15 percent.
We are therefore entering a perilous phase during
which economic growth remains low by historical
standards and financial risks have risen, yet inflation
has not yet decisively turned the corner. More than
ever, policymakers will need a steady hand and clear
communication. The appropriate course of action is
contingent on the state of the financial system. As
long as the latter remains reasonably stable, as it is
now, monetary policy should stay firmly focused on
bringing inflation down. A silver lining is that the
banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as
banks curtail lending in the face of rising funding
costs and of the need to act more prudently. In and
of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for
further monetary policy tightening. But any expectation that central banks will abandon the fight against
inflation would have the opposite effect: lowering
yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted,
and complicating the task of central banks. Tighter
fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling
off economic activity, it would support monetary
policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to
their low natural level (April 2023 WEO ­Chapter 2).
Appropriately designed fiscal consolidations will
also help rebuild much needed fiscal buffers and

help strengthen financial stability (April 2023 WEO
­Chapter 3; April 2023 Fiscal Monitor).
Should a systemic financial crisis loom large, a
careful and timely recalibration of policy will be
needed to safeguard both the financial system and
economic activity. It is important to stress that this is
not where we are, even if more financial tremors are
bound to occur. Regulators and supervisors should
act now to ensure these do not morph into a fullblown financial crisis by actively managing market
strains and strengthening oversight. For emerging
market and developing economies, this also means
ensuring proper access to the global financial safety
net, including the IMF’s precautionary arrangements,
and access to the Federal Reserve repurchase facility
for Foreign and International Monetary Authorities or to central bank swap lines, where relevant.
Exchange rates should adjust as much as possible
unless doing so raises financial stability risks or
threatens price stability, in line with our Integrated
Policy Framework.
Finally, our latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Fiveyear-ahead growth forecasts declined steadily from
4.6 percent in 2011 to 3.0 percent in 2023. Some of
this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously
rapidly growing economies such as China and Korea.
This is predictable: Growth slows down as countries
converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may
also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact
of the pandemic; a slower pace of structural reforms,
as well as the rising threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions; less direct investment; and a slower pace of innovation and technology
adoption across fragmented ‘blocs’ (April 2023 WEO
Chapter 4). A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve
progress for all or to allow us to tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Tentative signs in early 2023 that the world
economy could achieve a soft landing—with inflation
coming down and growth steady—have receded amid
stubbornly high inflation and recent financial sector
turmoil. Although inflation has declined as central
banks have raised interest rates and food and energy
prices have come down, underlying price pressures are
proving sticky, with labor markets tight in a number
of economies. Side effects from the fast rise in policy
rates are becoming apparent, as banking sector vulnerabilities have come into focus and fears of contagion
have risen across the broader financial sector, including nonbank financial institutions. Policymakers have
taken forceful actions to stabilize the banking system.
As discussed in depth in the Global Financial Stability
Report, financial conditions are fluctuating with the
shifts in sentiment.
In parallel, the other major forces that shaped the
world economy in 2022 seem set to continue into
this year, but with changed intensities. Debt levels
remain high, limiting the ability of fiscal policymakers
to respond to new challenges. Commodity prices that
rose sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
have moderated, but the war continues, and geopolitical tensions are high. Infectious COVID-19 strains
caused widespread outbreaks last year, but economies
that were hit hard—most notably China—appear
to be recovering, easing supply-chain disruptions.
Despite the fillips from lower food and energy prices
and improved supply-chain functioning, risks are
firmly to the downside with the increased uncertainty
from the recent financial sector turmoil.
The baseline forecast, which assumes that the recent
financial sector stresses are contained, is for growth
to fall from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.8 percent in
2023, before rising slowly and settling at 3.0 percent
five years out––the lowest medium-term forecast in
decades. Advanced economies are expected to see
an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from
2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.3 percent in 2023. In a plausible alternative scenario with further financial sector
stress, global growth declines to about 2.5 percent in
2023––the weakest growth since the global downturn

xvi

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

of 2001, barring the initial COVID-19 crisis in 2020
and during the global financial crisis in 2009––with
advanced economy growth falling below 1 percent.
The anemic outlook reflects the tight policy stances
needed to bring down inflation, the fallout from
the recent deterioration in financial conditions, the
ongoing war in Ukraine, and growing geoeconomic
fragmentation. Global headline inflation is set to fall
from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 7.0 percent in 2023 on
the back of lower commodity prices, but underlying
(core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most
cases. Once inflation rates are back to targets, deeper
structural drivers will likely reduce interest rates
toward their pre-pandemic levels (Chapter 2).
Risks to the outlook are heavily skewed to the
downside, with the chances of a hard landing having
risen sharply. Financial sector stress could amplify and
contagion could take hold, weakening the real economy through a sharp deterioration in financing conditions and compelling central banks to reconsider their
policy paths. Pockets of sovereign debt distress could,
in the context of higher borrowing costs and lower
growth, spread and become more systemic. The war
in Ukraine could intensify and lead to more food and
energy price spikes, pushing inflation up. Core inflation could turn out more persistent than anticipated,
requiring even more monetary tightening to tame.
Fragmentation into geopolitical blocs has the scope
to generate large output losses, including through its
effects on foreign direct investment (Chapter 4).
Policymakers have a narrow path to walk to
improve prospects and minimize risks. Central banks
need to remain steady with their tighter anti-inflation
stance, but also be ready to adjust and use their
full set of policy instruments—including to address
financial stability concerns—as developments demand.
Fiscal policymakers should buttress monetary and
financial policymakers’ actions in getting inflation
back to target while maintaining financial stability.
In most cases, governments should aim for an overall
tight stance while providing targeted support to those
struggling most with the cost-of-living crisis. In a

Executive Summary

severe downside scenario, automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate fully and temporary support
measures be utilized as needed, fiscal space permitting.
Medium-term debt sustainability will require welltimed fiscal consolidation but also debt restructuring in some cases (Chapter 3). Currencies should
be allowed to adjust to changing fundamentals, but
deploying capital flow management policies on outflows may be warranted in crisis or imminent crisis

circumstances, without substituting for needed macroeconomic policy adjustment. Measures to address
structural factors impeding supply could ameliorate
medium-term growth. Steps to strengthen multilateral
cooperation are essential to make progress in creating
a more resilient world economy, including by bolstering the global financial safety net, mitigating the costs
of climate change, and reducing the adverse effects of
geoeconomic fragmentation.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

A Rocky Recovery
The global economy is yet again at a highly uncertain moment, with the cumulative effects of the
past three years of adverse shocks—most notably,
the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine—manifesting in unforeseen ways. Spurred by
pent-up demand, lingering supply disruptions, and
commodity price spikes, inflation reached multidecade
highs last year in many economies, leading central
banks to tighten aggressively to bring it back toward
their targets and keep inflation expectations anchored.
Although telegraphed by central banks, the rapid
rise in interest rates and anticipated slowing of economic activity to put inflation on a downward path
have, together with supervisory and regulatory gaps
and the materialization of bank-specific risks, contributed to stresses in parts of the financial system,
raising financial stability concerns. Banks’ generally
strong liquidity and capital positions suggested that
they would be able to absorb the effects of monetary
policy tightening and adapt smoothly. However, some
financial institutions with business models that relied
heavily on a continuation of the extremely low nominal interest rates of the past years have come under
acute stress, as they have proved either unprepared or
unable to adjust to the fast pace of rate rises.
The unexpected failures of two specialized regional
banks in the United States in mid-March 2023 and
the collapse of confidence in Credit Suisse—a globally
significant bank—have roiled financial markets, with
bank depositors and investors reevaluating the safety
of their holdings and shifting away from institutions
and investments perceived as vulnerable. The loss of
confidence in Credit Suisse resulted in a brokered
takeover. Broad equity indices across major markets
have fallen below their levels prior to the turmoil,
but bank equities have come under extreme pressure
(Figure 1.1). Despite strong policy actions to support the banking sector and reassure markets, some
depositors and investors have become highly sensitive
to any news, as they struggle to discern the breadth
of vulnerabilities across banks and nonbank financial institutions and their implications for the likely

near-term path of the economy. Financial conditions
have tightened, which is likely to entail lower lending
and activity if they persist (see also Chapter 1 of the
April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report).
Prior to recent financial sector ructions, activity
in the world economy had shown nascent signs of
stabilizing in early 2023 after the adverse shocks of
last year (Figure 1.2, panels 1 and 2). Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine and the ongoing war caused severe commodity and energy price shocks and trade disruptions,
provoking the beginning of a significant reorientation
and adjustment across many economies. More contagious COVID-19 strains emerged and spread widely.
Outbreaks particularly affected activity in economies
in which populations had lower levels of immunity
and in which strict lockdowns were implemented,
such as in China. Although these developments
imperiled the recovery, activity in many economies
turned out better than expected in the second half of
2022, typically reflecting stronger-than-anticipated
domestic conditions. Labor markets in advanced
economies—most notably, the United States—have
stayed very strong, with unemployment rates historically low. Even so, confidence remains depressed
across all regions compared with where it was at the
beginning of 2022, before Russia invaded Ukraine and
the resurgence of COVID-19 in the second quarter
(Figure 1.2, panel 3).
With the recent increase in financial market volatility and multiple indicators pointing in different
directions, the fog around the world economic outlook
has thickened. Uncertainty is high, and the balance of
risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the
financial sector remains unsettled. The major forces
that affected the world in 2022—central banks’ tight
monetary stances to allay inflation, limited fiscal buffers to absorb shocks amid historically high debt levels,
commodity price spikes and geoeconomic fragmentation with Russia’s war in Ukraine, and China’s economic reopening—seem likely to continue into 2023.
But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting
with new financial stability concerns. A hard landing—
particularly for advanced economies—has become

Inflation Is Declining with Rapid Rate Rises but Remains
Elevated amid Financial Sector Stress

110

Global headline inflation has been declining since
mid-2022 at a three-month seasonally adjusted annualized rate (Figure 1.3). A fall in fuel and energy commodity prices, particularly for the United States, euro
area, and Latin America, has contributed to this decline
(see Figure 1.SF.1). To dampen demand and reduce
underlying (core) inflation, the lion’s share of central
banks around the world have been raising interest
rates since 2021, both at a faster pace and in a more
synchronous manner than in the previous global monetary tightening episode just before the global financial
crisis (Figure 1.4). This more restrictive monetary policy
has started to show up in a slowdown in new home
construction in many countries (see Box 1.1). Inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices has been
declining at a three-month rate—although at a slower
pace than headline inflation—in most (though not all)
major economies since mid-2022.
Even so, both headline and core inflation rates
remain at about double their pre-2021 levels on
average and far above target among almost all

inflation-targeting countries. Moreover, differences
across economies reflect their varying exposure to
underlying shocks. For example, headline inflation
is running at nearly 7 percent (year over year) in the
euro area—with some member states seeing rates
near 15 percent—and above 10 percent in the United
Kingdom, leaving household budgets stretched.
The effects of earlier cost shocks and historically
tight labor markets are also translating into more
persistent underlying price pressures and stickier
inflation. The labor market tightness in part reflects
a slow post-pandemic recovery in labor supply, with,
in particular, fewer older workers participating in
the labor force (Duval and others 2022). The ratios

of job openings to the number of people unemployed in the United States and the euro area at the
end of 2022 were at their highest levels in decades
(Figure 1.5). At the same time, the cost pressures
from wages have so far remained contained despite
the tightness of labor markets, with no signs of a
wage-price spiral dynamic—in which both wages and
prices accelerate in tandem for a sustained period—
taking hold. In fact, real wage growth in advanced
economies has been lower than it was at the end of
2021, unlike what took place in most of the earlier
historical episodes with circumstances similar to
those prevailing in 2021, when prices were accelerating and real wage growth was declining, on average
(Figure 1.6).
Inflation expectations have so far remained
anchored, with professional forecasters maintaining
their five-year-ahead projected inflation rates near
their pre-pandemic levels (Figure 1.7). To ensure this
remains the case, major central banks have generally
stayed firm in their communications about the need
for a restrictive monetary policy stance, signaling that
interest rates will stay higher for longer than previously
expected to address sticky inflation.

As of early 2023, however, financial markets anticipated that less policy tightening would be needed than
central banks suggested, leading to a divergence that
raised the risks for a significant market repricing. This
is most clearly evident in the case of the United States
(Figure 1.8, blue versus dashed black lines). A repricing
materialized in early March, with the market-implied
policy path shifting up to close much of the gap
with the Federal Reserve’s announced expected policy
path as markets responded to news about inflation
(Figure 1.8, green line). But recent financial sector
turbulence and the associated tightening of credit
conditions have pushed the market-implied policy
rate path back down, reopening the gap in the United
States (Figure 1.8, red line). This may reflect in part
the emergence of liquidity and safety premiums in
response to financial market volatility rather than pure
policy expectations. Nevertheless, the risks to financial

markets from sudden repricing due to policy rate
expectation changes—also highlighted in the January
2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update—remain
highly relevant (see also Chapter 1 of the April 2023
Global Financial Stability Report).

Indebtedness Staying High
As a result of the pandemic and economic upheaval
over the past three years, private and public debt have
reached levels not seen in decades in most economies
and remain high, despite their fall in 2021–22 on the
back of the economic rebound from COVID-19 and
the rise in inflation (see Chapter 1 of the April 2023
Fiscal Monitor and Chapter 3 of this report). Monetary
policy tightening—particularly by major advanced
economies—has led to sharp increases in borrowing
costs, raising concerns about the sustainability of some
economies’ debts. Among the group of emerging market and developing economies, the average level and
distribution of sovereign spreads increased markedly
in the summer of 2022, before coming down in early
2023 (Figure 1.9). The effects of the latest financial
market turmoil on emerging market and developing
economy sovereign spreads have been limited so far,

but there is a tangible risk of a surprise increase in
coming months should global financial conditions
tighten further. The share of economies at high risk of
debt distress remains high in historical context, leaving
many of them susceptible to unfavorable fiscal shocks
in the absence of policy actions (see Chapter 3).

Commodity Shocks Unwinding Even as Russia’s War in
Ukraine Persists
The shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022 continues to reverberate around the
world. Economic activity in Europe in 2022 was
more resilient than expected given the large negative
terms-of-trade fallout from the war and associated
economic sanctions. Large budgetary support measures for households and firms—on the order of
about 1.3 percent of GDP (net budgetary cost) in
the case of the European Union—were deployed to
help them weather the energy crisis. The stinging
hike in prices galvanized a reorientation of gas flows,
with marked increases in non-Russian pipeline and
liquefied natural gas deliveries to Europe, alongside

demand compression in the context of a mild winter
and adjustments by industries to substitute for gas and
to change production processes where feasible. Oil
and gas prices also began trending downward from
their peaks in mid-2022. Together, these actions and
channels have dampened the negative effects of the
energy crisis in Europe, with better-than-expected
levels of consumption and investment in the third
quarter of 2022.
Beyond Europe, a broad decline in food and energy
prices in the fourth quarter of 2022—although prices
are still high—has brought some relief to consumers
and commodity importers, contributing to the fall
in headline inflation. Sustaining lower prices this
year will depend on the absence of further negative
supply shocks.

China’s Economic Reopening
The evolution of especially contagious SARS-CoV-2
variants kindled a surge in COVID-19 around the
world in 2022. Eventually, these variants made their
way to China, which had hitherto escaped much of
the disease’s spread, partly through strict containment measures. As the country’s COVID restrictions
were ultimately lifted, multiple large outbreaks led
6

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

to declines in mobility and economic activity in the
fourth quarter of 2022 due to the disease’s direct
effects on human health and heightened fears of contagion (Figure 1.10). Supply disruptions also returned
to the fore, even if temporarily, leading to a rise in
supplier delivery times. The surge in infections compounded the headwinds from property market stresses
in China. Declining property sales and real estate
investment posed a drag on economic activity last year.
There remains a large backlog of presold unfinished
housing to be delivered, generating downward pressure
on house prices, which price floors have so far limited
in some regions.
The Chinese authorities have responded with a
variety of measures, including additional monetary
easing, tax relief for firms, new vaccination targets for
the elderly, and measures to encourage the completion and delivery of unfinished real estate projects. As
COVID-19 waves subsided in January of this year,
mobility normalized, and high-frequency economic
indicators—such as retail sales and travel bookings—
started picking up (Figure 1.10). With China absorbing about a quarter of exports from Asia and between
5 and 10 percent from other geographic regions, the
reopening and growth of its economy will likely generate positive spillovers (Figure 1.11; see also Srinivasan,
Helbling, and Peiris 2023), with even greater spillovers
for countries with stronger trade links and reliance on
Chinese tourism.

A Challenging Outlook
A return of the world economy to the pace of
economic growth that prevailed before the bevy of
shocks in 2022 and the recent financial sector turmoil
is increasingly elusive. More than a year after Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of more contagious COVID-19 variants, many economies are still
absorbing the shocks. The recent tightening in global
financial conditions is also hampering the recovery.
As a result, many economies are likely to experience slower growth in incomes in 2023, amid rising
joblessness. Moreover, even with central banks having
driven up interest rates to reduce inflation, the road
back to price stability could be long. Over the medium
term, the prospects for growth now seem dimmer
than in decades.
This section first describes the baseline projections for the global economy and the assumptions
on which they are predicated. The baseline scenario

assumes that the recent financial sector turmoil is
contained and does not generate material disruptions to global economic activity with widespread
recession (a broad-based contraction in economic
activity that usually lasts more than a few months).
Fuel and nonfuel commodity prices are generally
expected to decline in 2023, amid slowing global
demand (see the Commodity Special Feature). Crude
oil prices are projected to fall by about 24 percent
in 2023 and a further 5.8 percent in 2024, while
nonfuel commodity prices are expected to remain
broadly unchanged. The forecasts are also based on
the assumption that global interest rates will stay
elevated for longer than expected at the time the
October 2022 WEO was published, as central banks
remain focused on returning inflation to targets
while deploying tools to maintain financial stability
as needed (Figure 1.12). Governments are on average
expected to gradually withdraw fiscal policy support,
including, as commodity prices decline, by scaling
back packages designed to shield households and
firms from the effects of the fuel and energy price
spikes in 2022.

At the same time, in consideration of the elevated
risks and uncertainties stemming from the recent
global financial market turmoil, this section also places
strong emphasis on a plausible alternative scenario that
illustrates the impact of downside risks materializing.

Feeble and Uneven Growth
Baseline Scenario
The baseline forecast is for global output growth,
estimated at 3.4 percent in 2022, to fall to 2.8 percent
in 2023, 0.1 percentage point lower than predicted
in the January 2023 WEO Update (Table 1.1), before
rising to 3.0 percent in 2024. This forecast for the
coming years is well below what was expected before
the onset of the adverse shocks since early 2022.
Compared with the January 2022 WEO Update
forecast, global growth in 2023 is 1.0 percentage point

lower, and this growth gap is expected to close only
gradually in the coming two years (Figure 1.13). The
baseline prognosis is also weak by historical standards.
During the two pre-pandemic decades (2000–09 and
2010–19), world growth averaged 3.9 and 3.7 percent
a year, respectively.
For advanced economies, growth is projected to
decline by half in 2023 to 1.3 percent, before rising to
1.4 percent in 2024. Although the forecast for 2023
is modestly higher (by 0.1 percentage point) than in
the January 2023 WEO Update, it is well below the
2.6 percent forecast of January 2022. About 90 percent
of advanced economies are projected to see a decline in
growth in 2023. With the sharp slowdown, advanced
economies are expected to see higher unemployment:
a rise of 0.5 percentage point on average from 2022 to
2024 (Figure 1.14).
For emerging market and developing economies,
economic prospects are on average stronger than
for advanced economies, but these prospects vary
more widely across regions. On average, growth
is expected to be 3.9 percent in 2023 and to rise
to 4.2 percent in 2024. The forecast for 2023 is
modestly lower (by 0.1 percentage point) than in
the January 2023 WEO Update and significantly
below the 4.7 percent forecast of January 2022. In
low-income developing countries, GDP is expected to
grow by 5.1 percent, on average, over 2023–24, but
projected per capita income growth averages only
2.8 percent during 2023–24, below the average for

middle-income economies (3.2 percent) and so below
the path needed for standards of living to converge
with those in middle-income economies.
Plausible Alternative Scenario
Recent events have revealed how greater-thanexpected fragilities in segments of the banking systems
of the United States and of other regions can cause
financial sector turmoil. The fragilities come from a
combination of unrealized losses, which reflect the
speed and magnitude of monetary policy tightening,
and reliance on uninsured or wholesale funding. Further shocks stemming from such fragilities are plausible, with potentially significant impact on the global
economy. This subsection uses the IMF’s Group of
Twenty (G20) Model to analyze the economic consequences of a scenario in which pertinent and plausible
risks materialize.
The plausible alternative scenario assumes a moderate additional tightening in credit conditions. The
tightening stems from further stress in individual banks
that are vulnerable on two metrics: share of nonretail
or uninsured depositors and unrealized losses. Funding
conditions for all banks tighten, due to greater concern for bank solvency and potential exposures across
the financial system. Stricter supervision also adds to
more cautious bank behavior. The overall impact is a
decrease in the supply of credit and higher spreads for
nonfinancial firms and for households. It is assumed
that the stock of real bank lending in the United States

declines by 2 percent in 2023, relative to the baseline––
about one-tenth of the decrease experienced during
2008–09 and equivalent to a 150 basis point increase
in corporate spreads, on average, in 2023. The tightening gradually dissipates after 2023. A similar decrease
in credit and a similar increase in spreads occur in the
euro area and in Japan. Other countries also experience
a tightening in financial conditions, with the magnitude
related to how closely correlated their respective financial conditions are with conditions in the United States.
Countries are also affected through trade spillovers and
the impact on global commodity prices.
The scenario assumes that monetary policy responds to
the resulting decline in economic activity and inflationary pressures, with policy rates lower than in the baseline.
Regarding fiscal policy, it is assumed that automatic stabilizers operate but that there is no additional legislated
stimulus. Balance sheet policies and other interventions
by central banks and regulators, to preserve the stability
of the financial system, are not explicitly modeled but are
implicitly assumed to help avert a larger crisis.
Figure 1.15 summarizes the global effects of this
plausible alternative scenario on the level of real GDP in
2023 and 2024. Results are presented as percent deviations from the baseline forecast. The moderate tightening
in financial conditions leads to a decrease in the level
of world output by 0.3 percent in 2023, implying real
growth of about 2.5 percent instead of 2.8 percent in the
baseline forecast––the lowest outcome since the global
slowdown of 2001, excluding the initial COVID-19

crisis in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2009.
Real GDP is 0.2 percent lower than the baseline in
2024 and gradually recovers thereafter. The effects are
generally larger in advanced economies than in emerging
market economies, with growth falling below 1 percent
compared with 1.3 percent in the baseline forecast.
The United States, the euro area, and Japan have the
largest declines in growth compared with the baseline:
about 0.4 percentage point lower in 2023. Countries
with greater trade exposures to the United States (such as
Mexico and Canada) experience a sharper impact; those
with smaller exposures (such as China) are less affected.

Inflation: Still High but Falling
The baseline forecast is for global headline (consumer
price index) inflation to decline from 8.7 percent in
2022 to 7.0 percent in 2023. This forecast is higher (by
0.4 percentage point) than that of January 2023 but
nearly double the January 2022 forecast (Figure 1.16).
Disinflation is expected in all major country groups, with
about 76 percent of economies expected to experience
lower headline inflation in 2023. Initial differences in
the level of inflation between advanced economies and
emerging market and developing economies are, however,
expected to persist. The projected disinflation reflects
declining fuel and nonfuel commodity prices as well as
the expected cooling effects of monetary tightening on
economic activity. At the same time, inflation excluding
that for food and energy is expected to decline globally

much more gradually in 2023: by only 0.2 percentage
point, to 6.2 percent, reflecting the aforementioned stickiness of underlying inflation. This forecast is higher (by
0.5 percentage point) than that of January 2023.
Overall, returning inflation to target is expected to
take until 2025 in most cases. A comparison of official
inflation targets with the latest forecasts for 72 inflation-targeting economies (34 advanced economies and
38 major emerging market and developing economies)
suggests that annual average inflation will exceed targets (or the midpoints of target ranges) in 97 percent
of cases in 2023 (Figure 1.17). The median deviation
from target is expected to be 3.3 percentage points.
In 2024, inflation is still expected to exceed targets in
91 percent of cases, with an expected median deviation
of about 1 percentage point. Among countries with an
inflation target range, however, inflation is expected to
be in the target range in about 50 percent of cases in
2024. By 2025, inflation is expected to be close to targets (or the midpoints of target ranges), with a median
deviation of only 0.2 percentage point.

In the aforementioned plausible alternative scenario,
with additional tightening in credit conditions, global
headline inflation decreases by about 0.2 percentage

commodity prices. Oil prices decline by 3 percent
more, on average, in 2023 than in the baseline.
There is a modest additional fall in inflation excluding
food and energy.

The Medium Term: Not What It Used to Be
The world economy is not currently expected to
return over the medium term to the rates of growth
that prevailed before the pandemic. Looking out to
2028, global growth is forecast at 3.0 percent––the
lowest medium-term growth forecast published in all
WEO reports since 1990 (Figure 1.18). Forecasts of
medium-term growth peaked at about 4.9 percent

in 2008. The decline in medium-term global growth
prospects reflects the progress that several economies,
such as China and Korea, have made in increasing
their living standards and the associated decline in the
rate of change (see Chapter 2 and Kremer, Willis, and
You 2022). It also reflects slower global labor force
growth––United Nations medium-term population
growth projections have declined since 2010 by about
one-quarter of a percentage point. Geoeconomic
fragmentation, including developments stemming from
Brexit, ongoing US-China trade disputes, and Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine (Aiyar and others 2023), has also
contributed to the weaker outlook, as has a slower
expected pace of supply-enhancing reforms. Dimmer
prospects for growth in China and other large emerging
market economies will weigh on the prospects of trading
partners through the world’s highly integrated supply
chains. It will also complicate the efforts of middle- and
low-income countries seeking to converge to higher
standards of living.
Moreover, with global growth over the coming years
not expected to overshoot pre-2022 shock forecasts,
the level of global output is unlikely to recover to its
previous path. The shortfall of global GDP in 2022
compared with January 2022 WEO Update forecasts is
about 1 percent. By 2026, the output loss (cumulative
growth gap) is projected to widen to 2.7 percent: more
than double the initial impact. Persistent effects

are expected to narrow gradually as commodity
prices decline.
Creditor and debtor stock positions remained historically elevated in 2022, reflecting the offsetting effects
of widening current account balances and the dollar’s
strength, which caused valuation gains in countries

recession and the shift in the composition of spending from traded goods back toward domestic services.
Rising trade barriers and the lagged effects of US dollar
appreciation in 2022, which made traded products
more costly for numerous economies given the dollar’s
dominant role in invoicing, are also expected to
weigh on trade growth in 2023. Overall, the outlook is for weaker trade growth than during the two
pre-pandemic decades (2000–19), when it averaged
4.9 percent.
Meanwhile, global current account balances––the
sums of absolute surpluses and deficits––are expected
to narrow in 2023, following their significant increase
in 2022 (Figure 1.19). As reported in the IMF’s 2022
External Sector Report, the rise in current account

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

Risks to the outlook are squarely to the downside.
Much uncertainty clouds the short- and medium-term
outlook as the global economy adjusts to the shocks
of 2020–22 and the recent financial sector turmoil.
Recession concerns have gained prominence, while
worries about stubbornly high inflation persist.
There is a significant risk that the recent banking
system turbulence will result in a sharper and more
persistent tightening of global financial conditions than
anticipated in the baseline and plausible alternative
scenarios, which would further deteriorate business
and consumer confidence. Additional downside risks
include sharper contractionary effects than expected
from the synchronous central bank rate hikes amid
historically high private and public debt levels (see
Box 1.2). The combination of higher borrowing costs
and lower growth could cause systemic debt distress
in emerging market and developing economies. In
addition, inflation may prove stickier than expected,
prompting further monetary tightening than currently
anticipated. Other adverse risks include a faltering
in China’s post–COVID-19 recovery, escalation of
the war in Ukraine, and geoeconomic fragmentation further hindering multilateral efforts to address
economic challenges. With debt levels, inflation, and
financial market volatility elevated, policymakers have
limited space to offset new negative shocks, especially
in low-income countries.
On the upside, the global economy could prove
more resilient than expected, just as it did in 2022.
With a stock of excess savings from the pandemic
years and tight labor markets in a number of economies, household consumption could again overshoot
forecasts, although this would complicate the fight
against inflation. A renewed easing in supply-chain

CHAPTER 1

bottlenecks––the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
Global Supply Chain Pressure Index recently eased to
more normal levels, for example––and a cooling in
labor markets from falling vacancies rather than rising
unemployment could allow for a softer-than-expected
landing, requiring less monetary tightening.
Overall, the estimated probability of global growth
in 2023 falling below 2.0 percent—an outcome that
has occurred on only five occasions since 1970 (in
1973, 1981, 1982, 2009, and 2020)––is now about
25 percent: more than double the normal probability
(see Box 1.3). Growth falling below 2.0 percent could
occur in the case of a severe credit disruption or from
a combination of shocks materializing together. A contraction in global per capita real GDP in 2023—which
often happens when there is a global recession—has
an estimated probability of about 15 percent. Turning
to prices, the probability of global headline inflation
exceeding its 2022 level in 2023, is less than 10 percent, as Box 1.3 explains. However, for core inflation,
which is set to decline more gradually in 2023, the
probability is higher, at 30 percent. Stickier services
inflation, amid still-overheating labor markets, could
push core inflation above its 2022 level. In what
follows, the most prominent downside risks to the
outlook are discussed.
A severe tightening in global financial conditions: In
many countries, the financial sector will remain highly
vulnerable to the realized rise in real interest rates in
the coming months, both in banks and in nonbank
financial institutions (see Chapter 1 of the April 2023
Global Financial Stability Report). In a severe downside
scenario in which risks stemming from bank balance
sheet fragilities materialize, bank lending in the United
States and other advanced economies could sharply
decline, with macroeconomic effects amplified by a
number of channels. Household and business confidence would deteriorate, leading to higher household
precautionary saving and lower investment. Depressed
activity in the most affected economies would spill
over to the rest of the world through lower demand
for imports and lower commodity prices. As in past
episodes of global financial stress, a broad-based
outflow of capital from emerging market and developing ­economies could occur, causing further dollar
appreciation, which would worsen vulnerabilities in
economies with dollar-denominated external debt. The
dollar appreciation would further depress global trade,
as many products are invoiced in dollars. In an environment of elevated financial fragility, contagion could

Global Prospects and Policies

occur, with a sharp loss of investor appetite spreading
across geographic regions and asset types. The market
for safe assets (such as US or German government
bonds) could also seize up, with reduced ease of trading amid a rush out of riskier assets.
Box 1.3 provides a quantification of such a scenario of severe financial sector stress and concludes
that, even with monetary policy responding to the
decline in economic activity and inflation and even
with fiscal automatic stabilizers operating, global real
GDP growth in 2023 could be 1.8 percentage points
below the baseline. Such an outcome would imply
near-zero growth in global GDP per capita. The
downturn in global aggregate demand would have
a strong disinflationary impulse, with global headline and core inflation lower by about 1 percentage
point in 2023.
Sharper monetary policy impact amid high debt:
The interaction between rising real interest rates and
historically elevated corporate and household debt is
another source of downside risk, as debt servicing costs
rise amid weaker income growth. This can lead to debt
overhang, with lower-than-expected investment and
consumption, higher unemployment, and widespread
bankruptcies, especially in economies with elevated
house prices and high levels of household debt issued
at floating rates (see Box 1.1). In such a case, inflation
would decline faster and growth would be lower than
in the baseline forecast.
Stickier inflation: With labor markets remaining exceptionally tight in many countries, the
incipient decline in headline and core inflation could stall before reaching target levels,
amid stronger-than-expected wage growth. An
even-stronger-than-predicted economic rebound in
China could––especially if combined with an escalation of the war in Ukraine—reverse the expected
decline in commodity prices, raise headline inflation,
and pass through into core inflation and inflation
expectations. Such conditions could prompt central
banks in major economies to tighten policies further
and keep a restrictive stance for longer, with adverse
effects on growth and financial stability.
Systemic sovereign debt distress in emerging market
and developing economies: Several emerging market
and developing economies still face sovereign credit
spreads above 1,000 basis points. The easing in spreads
since October, which partly reflects the depreciation
of the US dollar and lower import bills from declining commodity prices, has provided some relief.

(2018). LIDCs = low-income developing countries; PPG = public and publicly
guaranteed; PRGT = Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust.

But vulnerabilities remain high. About 56 percent
of low-income developing countries are estimated to
be either already in debt distress or at high risk of it
(Figure 1.20, panel 3), and about 25 percent of emerging market economies are also estimated to be at high
risk. While the level of external debt as a share of gross
national income is on average one-third lower today
than in the 1980s and 1990s (Figure 1.20, panel 1),
16

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

some vulnerabilities are more acute. A higher share of
external debt is now issued at variable interest rates and
in US dollars, implying greater exposure to monetary tightening in advanced economies (Figure 1.20,
panel 2). And for low-income countries, comparisons
with the situation in the mid-1990s are increasingly relevant (IMF 2022a). A new wave of debt-restructuring
requests could take place, but the creditor landscape has
become more complex, making restructuring potentially more difficult than in the past (see Chapter 3).
The share of external debt owed to Paris Club official bilateral creditors fell from 39 percent in 1996
to 12 percent in 2020, and that owed to non–Paris
Club official bilateral creditors rose from 8 percent to
22 percent; the share of private creditors doubled from
8 percent to 16 percent (IMF 2022a).
Faltering growth in China: With a substantial
share of economies’ exports absorbed by China, a
weaker-than-expected recovery in China would have
significant cross-border effects, especially for commodity exporters and tourism-dependent economies.
Risks to the outlook include the ongoing weakness
in the Chinese real estate market, which could pose
a larger-than-expected drag on growth and potentially lead to financial stability risks (see Box 1.1
and IMF 2023).
Escalation of the war in Ukraine: An escalation of
Russia’s war in Ukraine––now in its second year––
could trigger a renewed energy crisis in Europe and
exacerbate food insecurity in low-income countries. For the winter of 2022–23, a gas crisis was
averted, with ample storage at European facilities
thanks to higher liquefied natural gas imports, lower
gas demand amid high prices, and atypically mild
weather. The risks of price spikes, however, remain for
next winter (see the Commodity Special Feature). A
possible increase in food prices from a failed extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative would weigh
further on food importers, particularly those that lack
fiscal space to cushion the impact on households and
businesses. Amid elevated food and fuel prices, social
unrest might increase.
Fragmentation further hampers multilateral cooperation:
The ongoing retreat from cross-border economic integration began more than a decade ago after the global
financial crisis, with notable developments including
Brexit and China-US trade tensions. The war in Ukraine
has reinforced this trend by raising geopolitical tensions
(Figure 1.21, panel 1) and splitting the world economy
into geopolitical blocs. Barriers to trade are steadily

CHAPTER 1

increasing (Figure 1.21, panel 2). They range from the
imposition of export bans on food and fertilizers in
response to the commodity price spike following Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine to restrictions on trade in microchips and semiconductors (as in the US Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science
Act) and on green investment that are aimed at preventing the transfer of technology and include local-content
requirements. Further geoeconomic fragmentation risks
not only lower cross-border flows of labor, goods, and
capital (see Chapter 4 of this report and Chapter 3 of
the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report) but
also reduced international action on vital global public
goods, such as climate change mitigation and pandemic
resilience. Some countries may benefit from an associated rearrangement in global production, but the overall
impact on economic well-being would likely be negative
(see Aiyar and others 2023 and Chapter 3 of the
October 2022 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and the
Pacific), with costs particularly high in the short term, as
replacing disrupted flows takes time.

With the fog around current and prospective
economic conditions thickening, policymakers have
a narrow path to walk toward restoring price stability
while avoiding a recession and maintaining financial
stability. Achieving strong, sustainable, and inclusive
growth will require policymakers to stay agile and be
ready to adjust as information becomes available.

Policies with Immediate Impact
Ensuring a durable fall in inflation: With inflation
still well above targets for most economies, the priority
remains reducing inflation and ensuring that expectations stay anchored while containing financial market
strains and minimizing the risk of further turbulence.
Achieving this outcome in the midst of heightened
market volatility and a sizable disconnect between
markets’ anticipation of monetary policy paths and
central bank communications requires the following:
•• Steady but ready monetary policy: Under the baseline
forecast, real (inflation-adjusted) policy rates in
major economies are expected to increase gradually,
even as the pace of nominal rate rises slows on the
back of declining inflation (Figure 1.22). Where
core inflation pressures persist, raising real policy
rates and holding them above their neutral levels

would ward off the risk of de-anchoring inflation expectations. Given the elevated volatility in
financial markets, central banks should stand ready
to address liquidity and financial sector risks if and
when needed, as discussed later. Under the plausible alternative scenario, in which the tightening of
financial conditions leads to a cooling in real activity
and lower price pressures, central banks would need
to carefully recalibrate monetary policy, including
the timing and size of policy rate changes needed to
align inflation rates with their targets. If the severe
downside scenario materializes and financial stability
is at stake, substantial readjustment of monetary
policy paths might be needed in response to the
disinflationary shock to minimize economic damage
and contain financial sector contagion.
•• Clear communication: Given heightened uncertainty
regarding the effects of monetary policy on both
inflation and financial stability, and the reemerging
disconnect between central banks, and markets’
expectations of monetary policy paths, clear communication about central bank policy objectives and
responses will be crucial. Estimates of the real interest

rate consistent with stable inflation (commonly
called the “natural rate of interest” and denoted r*)
are uncertain (see Chapter 2). An unemployment
rate above the level consistent with stable inflation
(commonly called the “natural rate of unemployment” and denoted u*) would contribute to reducing inflation. But as with r*, estimates are highly
uncertain. For example, recent estimates of u* for
the United States range from 4 percent to 7 percent,
which is above the current unemployment rate. This
has contributed to projections of rising unemployment by 2024 (Figure 1.23). It will be essential that,
faced with such uncertainty, monetary policymakers
calibrate policy in a data-dependent manner. In
addition, volatility has been unusually high: markets
have reacted strongly to any news, leading to sudden
repricing in the path of policy rates and amplifying
the disconnect between market expectations and
the rate path communicated by central banks. In
that context, policymakers should reinforce their
communication about the likely need for a restrictive monetary policy stance until there is tangible
evidence that inflation is returning toward target. At
the same time, policymakers should reassure market
participants that they stand ready to change course
and use the full set of available instruments should
market turmoil deepen.

•• Applying the lessons from past premature easing: An
easing of rates before price pressures have adequately
receded could increase the costs of disinflation, as
exemplified by the experience of the United States
in the early 1980s. The Federal Reserve loosened
policy after a first wave of tightening and an increase
in unemployment, which contributed to expectations that high inflation would solidify (Goodfriend
and King 2005). A second wave of sharp policy rate
increases was required to bring inflation down and
reestablish credibility, with more negative growth
and employment implications (Figure 1.24).
Safeguarding financial stability: Minimizing financial
stability risks will require careful monitoring of risks,
managing market strains, and strengthening oversight.
•• Monitoring risks: In this period of high uncertainty
and market volatility, monitoring the buildup of
risks across industries and promptly addressing vulnerabilities that come to the fore will be crucial to
restore confidence and safeguard financial stability
(see Chapter 1 of the April 2023 Global Financial
Stability Report). As central banks continue raising
rates to fight inflation and gradually unwind their

CHAPTER 1

balance sheets, more intensive and high-frequency
monitoring of risks in the banking sector, nonbank
financial institutions, and the housing sector will
be essential.
•• Managing market strains: Where market strains
emerge, deploying tools that provide liquidity
support promptly and forcefully, while mitigating
the risk of moral hazard, will be necessary to ease
pressures and limit contagion. Liquidity support
should be targeted as well as properly collateralized
and preserve the transmission of monetary policy.
Intervention and resolution procedures may need
to be initiated promptly for weak and nonviable
institutions.
•• Strengthening oversight: Financial sector regulations
introduced after the global financial crisis contributed
to the resilience of banks throughout the pandemic.
More efforts are needed, however, to address
shortcomings in the supervisory oversight of banks,
including in the prudential framework for exposures
to interest rate risk, and to ensure that stringent prudential requirements align with the Basel framework
on capital and liquidity regulations. In addition,
the intensity of supervision must be commensurate
with banks’ risks and systemic importance, and it is
essential to address supervisory gaps in the nonbank
financial sector (see also Chapter 1 of the April 2023
Global Financial Stability Report).
•• Using the global financial safety net: With multiple
shocks hitting the global economy, it is appropriate
to make full use of the global financial safety net
afforded by international financial institutions. This
includes proactively employing the IMF’s precautionary financial arrangements and focusing aid
from the international community on low-income
countries facing shocks, including through the
rechanneling of special drawing rights and support
from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and
the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. The recent
enhancement of dollar funding swap lines between
the Federal Reserve and major advanced economy
central banks should help limit financial strains. It is
important to ensure that other central banks are also
able to access liquidity to guard against potential
external funding shocks.
Dealing with currency swings: The US dollar has
depreciated in real terms since October 2022—by
6 percent on a trade-weighted basis––but remains
stronger than it has been since 2000, reflecting

economic fundamentals such as the rapid tightening
of US monetary policy and more favorable terms of
trade for the United States (Figure 1.25). Emerging
market economies should let their currencies adjust
as much as possible in response to such fundamentals (Gopinath and Gourinchas 2022). As guided
by the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework, foreign
exchange interventions may be appropriate on a
temporary basis if currency movements and capital
flows substantially raise financial stability risks––as in
the context of shallow foreign exchange markets or
high foreign currency debt––or jeopardize the central
bank’s ability to maintain price stability. Temporary
capital flow management measures on outflows may
also be useful in a crisis or when one is imminent
but should not substitute for needed macroeconomic
policy adjustment. In response to developments
in 2022, some economies resorted to capital flow
management measures (for example, China and
Malawi, among others).
Normalizing fiscal policy: As deficits and debts
remain above pre-pandemic levels, fiscal efforts will be
warranted in 2023. Fiscal policymakers should support
monetary policy in getting inflation back to target.
Where inflation remains high, a steady tightening of

the fiscal stance would moderate the need for monetary tightening. In a severe downside scenario, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, and
temporary support measures should be used as needed
(including to buttress the financial system), with due
consideration of available fiscal space (see Chapter 1 of
the April 2023 Fiscal Monitor). Protecting the vulnerable through targeted measures should remain a priority.
Supporting the vulnerable: The surge in global energy
and food prices in 2022 triggered a cost-of-living crisis
in many countries, especially low-income countries,
many of which are still suffering from food insecurity. Governments acted swiftly to extend support to
households and firms, which helped cushion the effects
on growth. However, the fiscal support extended to
households and firms in many European economies
was largely untargeted (Figure 1.26). Such broad-based
measures are becoming increasingly costly and should
be replaced by more targeted approaches (Ari and
others 2022). Moreover, in the event of a renewed
commodity price spike, measures taken should preserve
the market signal from higher energy prices as much as
possible, as high prices encourage a reduction in energy
consumption, limiting the risks of shortages (see also
the October 2022 Fiscal Monitor).
Improving food security everywhere: Trade restrictions
on food and fertilizers run the risk of pushing a large
share of the global population into food insecurity.

For example, emerging market and developing economies’ net imports of wheat account for more than half
of total wheat consumption, but domestic storage in
these economies tends to be low, making them more
vulnerable to trade shocks (Figure 1.27). Restrictions
on exports of food and fertilizers—particularly those
most recently imposed—should be lifted to safeguard
food supplies and their distribution globally.

Policies with Payoffs in the Medium Term
Restoring debt sustainability: With lower growth and
higher borrowing costs, public debt ratios are becoming unsustainable in many countries. Actions must be
taken to put them on a credible downward path. For
economies at high risk of debt distress (Figure 1.20),
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to create sound policy frameworks and revitalize growth
remain the fundamental solution to sustainable debt

CHAPTER 1

(Box 3.1). In some cases, debt restructuring may be
necessary to help reduce fiscal vulnerabilities. As shown
in Chapter 3, waiting to restructure debt until after
a default occurs is associated with larger declines in
a country’s output, investment, private sector credit,
and capital inflows than when debt restructuring is
preemptive. The world is at a critical juncture, and
international cooperation is needed to reduce the
likelihood of a snowballing global debt crisis. Progress
has been made in regard to countries that requested
debt treatment under the G20 Common Framework
(for example, Chad). Official and private creditors need
to stand ready to respond swiftly to requests from a
broad set of countries, including the poorest nations
that were part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, as well as middle-income economies under stress
(for example, Sri Lanka). It is also necessary to agree
on mechanisms to address debt-restructuring needs for
a broader set of economies, including middle-income
economies that are not eligible under the current
Common Framework. Large creditors, including non–
Paris Club and private creditors, have a crucial role to
play in ensuring effective, predictable, and timely debt
resolution processes. The newly created Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) will help multilateral
agencies and private and public creditors identify key
impediments to restructurings and design standards
and processes that can address them.
Reinforcing supply: Well-designed supply-side
policies could help address structural factors impeding
medium-term growth and recoup some of the output
losses accumulated since the pandemic. Policy actions
could include structural reforms to reduce harmful
market power and rent-seeking behavior as well as
overly rigid regulation and planning processes. They
could also involve stimulating investment in infrastructure improvements and productive digitalization
initiatives and enhancing access to and quality of
education. Policies intended to reduce labor market
tightness—by encouraging participation and reducing
job search and matching frictions—would also help
smooth inflation’s path back to target. They could
include adopting measures to bolster active labor
market policies, such as short-term training programs
for professions experiencing shortages, passing labor
laws and regulations that increase work flexibility
through telework and leave policies, and allowing for
the resumption of regular immigration flows. Industrial policy could be pursued if frictions (for instance,
market failures) are well established and if other

policies are not available. Industrial policy should not
introduce distortions and should be consistent with
international agreements and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. This will also help prevent unnecessary business uncertainty. Where industrial policies are
rolled out, wasteful subsidy races or the imposition of
domestic production requirements should be avoided.
Such measures could lead to lower productivity and
undermine trade relations and would be particularly damaging to emerging market and developing economies.
Containing pandemic risks: Authorities should
remain vigilant to the risks of a reemergence of the
COVID-19 virus and new pandemics and their
potential impacts on the global economy. This includes
coordinated efforts to boost access to vaccines and
medicines where immunity is low and greater public support for vaccine development and systematic
responses to future epidemics.

bolster the global economy’s resilience and achieve the
best outcomes. To this end, actions on fundamental
areas of common interest are critical to improving trust
and limiting the risks stemming from increasing geopolitical fragmentation. Strengthening the multilateral
trading system would help reduce the risks to growth
and resilience from such fragmentation by providing
fair and predictable rules for exchange. To achieve such
strengthening, WTO rules in critical areas such as
agricultural and industrial subsidies must be upgraded,
new WTO-based agreements implemented, and the
WTO dispute settlement system fully restored.
Speeding up the green transition: Progress in emission
reductions needed to contain global warming at 2°C
or less remains inadequate. Implementing credible
policies now will limit the overall costs of mitigation

22

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

(see Chapter 3 of the October 2022 World Economic
Outlook). International coordination on carbon pricing
or equivalent policies would facilitate a faster decarbonization in a cost-efficient way. With declining investment in fossil fuels, a concerted push on alternative
clean energy investment could help ensure sufficient
energy supplies and achieve the needed decarbonization.
This could be achieved through investment incentives
for green materials and electricity grid upgrades, easing
of permitting processes for renewables, and support for
research and development, among other efforts. The
meetings at the 27th United Nations Climate Change
Conference of the Parties resulted in encouraging signs
of international cooperation on adaptation to climate
change, but more needs to be done, including channeling aid to vulnerable countries.

CHAPTER 1

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.1. House Prices: Coming off the Boil
As central banks raised borrowing costs to fight inflation
in 2022, real house price growth turned negative in both
advanced and emerging market economies. If mortgage
rates continue to rise, demand for borrowing is likely to
weaken, further depressing house prices. Economies with
elevated house prices and high levels of household debt
issued at floating rates are particularly vulnerable to any
ensuing financial sector stress.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, real house prices
rose to record levels in many countries—especially among
advanced economies—reflecting a combination of ample
policy support and limited numbers of available properties on the market. In the second quarter of 2022, however, quarterly real house prices fell, with about two-thirds
of economies experiencing negative growth and the
remainder positive but slower growth (Figure 1.1.1).
Among advanced economies, the deterioration in the
housing market was more pronounced in those that
showed signs of overvaluation before and during the pandemic. With central banks hiking interest rates, mortgage
rates climbed to an average of 6.8 percent in advanced
economies in late 2022, up from 2.8 percent in January
2022. If mortgage rates continue to rise, demand for
borrowing and house prices are likely to weaken further.

Who Is at Risk?
Housing markets and prices are likely to cool more
and be more sensitive to policy rate hikes in economies

How Is This Housing Episode Different from the
2007–08 Global Financial Crisis Episode?
In most cases, it is unlikely that an ongoing fall
in house prices will lead to a financial crisis, but a
sharp drop in house prices could adversely affect the
economic outlook. The buildup of medium-term vulnerabilities warrants close monitoring and, potentially,

policy intervention.1 Data from 2021 show that
banks are better capitalized than before the global
financial crisis, with the regulatory ratio of Tier 1
capital to risk-weighted assets standing at 17.5 percent
on average across countries (IMF 2021), compared
with 13.4 percent in 2007. Moreover, banks’ underwriting standards in many advanced economies are
tighter today than before the global financial crisis.
However, the average household debt-to-income ratio
across countries in 2022 was on par with that in
2007, driven mainly by households in economies that
managed to escape the brunt of the global financial
crisis and have since run up substantial borrowing
(Figure 1.1.3).
At the same time, in China, the real estate sector
has experienced a protracted contraction, with early
signs of stabilization in 2023. Share prices of property
developers rebounded partially following the wave of
support measures announced in November 2022, but
a correction in house prices could intensify financial
stress for property developers. The Chinese economy
is vulnerable to a correction in real estate prices, as
the real estate and construction sectors account for
about one-fifth of final demand absorption and a
significant fraction of lending (IMF 2022b). Although
the Chinese authorities have recently stepped up their
support to the sector, the share of property developers
in need of restructuring remains large (IMF 2023),
and the loosening of lending standards could exacerbate financial stability risks.
1See the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report for
analysis of the risks to the global economic outlook from a sharp
decline in house prices.

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.2. Monetary Policy: Speed of Transmission, Heterogeneity, and Asymmetries
Understanding how long monetary policy takes to affect
output and inflation is central to policy deliberations.
The literature has not yet reached consensus, but several
factors are known to shape the effects. Central bank
credibility and mortgage rate flexibility increase transmission speed. Other factors, such as financial development and offsetting (uncoordinated) fiscal policies,
reduce it. With the ongoing synchronous tightening,
a faster and stronger response of economic output and
prices could occur.

Transmission Speed
A review of studies1 on the United States and
the euro area reveals that estimates of the timing of
monetary policy transmission to output vary between
near-immediate effects and a lag of about three
quarters. Later, output usually reverts to its initial level
within two to three years, although more persistent
effects may occur. Estimates of the lag in transmission of monetary policy to prices vary as well. At the
upper end, estimates indicate a delay of about 1.5 to
2.5 years. This lag might be driven by firms’ staggered
price adjustment, or it might be due to informational
frictions that make it difficult to disentangle pure
monetary policy shocks from outlook information that
central banks convey during policy announcements.
At the lower end of the range of estimates, studies
accounting for the information component find that
prices decline immediately following monetary shocks.
The immediate response is driven by exchange rate
appreciation and changes in inflation expectations. In
addition, macroeconomic variables are found to react
faster to forward guidance, since it may signal a more
persistent change in financial market conditions.

Country Heterogeneity
A meta-analysis of 67 published studies covering
30 different economies (Havranek and Rusnak 2013)
finds that the effect of a tightening on prices takes
an average of about three years to reach its trough,
Prepared by Silvia Albrizio and Francesco Grigoli. Yang Liu
provided research support.
1The review considers the following studies, among others:
Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz (2005); Choi and others (2022);
Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin (2010); Gertler and Karadi
(2015); Jarociński and Karadi (2020); Miranda-Agrippino and
Ricco (2021); and Romer and Romer (2004). These estimates
refer to the time it takes for macroeconomic variables to start
responding to monetary policy shocks in a statistically significant way.

with a wide range (Figure 1.2.1). Prices in advanced
economies take about twice the time needed in
emerging market and developing economies. Multiple
country-specific factors may affect the transmission
channels of monetary policy, consequently shaping the
speed and strength of the transmission.
•• Financial development affects the credit channel.
Developed financial systems provide more opportunities to hedge against monetary surprises in
advanced economies, delaying the impact of a
policy adjustment (Havranek and Rusnak 2013). At
the same time, more competitive financial sectors
exhibit faster and more complete interest rate
pass-through (Georgiadis 2014).
•• Financial frictions affect the investment channel and
capital reallocation. Firms’ investment sensitivity to
monetary policy is higher for low-liquidity firms,
since it increases their fixed-debt issuance costs
(Jeenas 2019); for younger non-dividend-paying
firms, since their external finances are more
exposed to asset value fluctuations (Cloyne and
others, forthcoming); for low-risk firms, since their
marginal cost of investment finance is flatter than

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

25

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

Box 1.2 (continued)
that of high-risk firms (Ottonello and Winberry
2020); and for firms with a high marginal product
of capital, since they are financially constrained
(González and others 2022; Albrizio, González, and
Khametshin 2023). Overall, following a monetary
tightening, investment declines more in countries
with higher levels of financial frictions, capital
misallocation increases, and productivity declines.
•• Central bank credibility and effective communication strongly affect the expectation and exchange rate
channels. When inflation expectations are well
anchored and central bank independence is high,
monetary policy is more effective at restoring price
stability with a lower output cost (Chapter 3 of the
October 2018 World Economic Outlook; Bems and
others 2020). Conversely, if expectations are more
backward looking, as in many emerging market and
developing economies, a stronger monetary policy
reaction to reanchor expectations is warranted
(Chapter 2 of the October 2022 World Economic
Outlook; Alvarez and Dizioli 2023), and the
exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices will
be stronger (Carrière-Swallow and others 2021).
•• The household wealth and income distribution shapes
the consumption and saving channels. Households
with a mortgage are the most responsive to monetary policy tightening, as they reduce spending
on durables (Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico 2020).
Moreover, households adjust their decisions
depending on the liquidity of their asset holdings: Households at the bottom of the liquid asset
distribution decrease their consumption, households
at the midpoint reduce saving or increase borrowing, and households at the top increase consumption substantially on account of a rise in interest
income (Holm, Paul, and Tischbirek 2021). Finally,
high-income consumers cut spending more than
low-income consumers, possibly because of less
binding borrowing constraints and stronger intertemporal substitution effects triggered by higher
interest rates (Grigoli and Sandri 2022).
Nominal rigidities shape the output effect of monetary policy in multiple ways. Greater wage rigidities
amplify the output effect (Olivei and Tenreyro 2010).

26

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

Conversely, mortgage rate rigidities dampen this effect,
by decreasing the responsiveness of residential investment (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca 2013) and the
sensitivity of defaults, house prices, car purchases, and
employment (Di Maggio and others 2017) to interest
rate changes. Therefore, a large share of adjustable-rate
mortgages, more common in emerging market and
developing economies (Cerutti and others 2016),
amplifies the contractionary output effect of monetary tightening.

Asymmetric Effects
Monetary policy shocks may have asymmetric and
cyclically dependent output and inflation effects.
There is evidence that policy easing has large effects
on prices but small effects on real activity, whereas
policy tightening has large output effects, especially
during booms, but small effects on prices (Barnichon
and Matthes 2018; Angrist, Jordà, and Kuersteiner
2018; Forni and others 2020; Tenreyro and Thwaites
2016). These asymmetric effects might be driven by
the presence of downward nominal rigidities (Forni
and others 2020); by the interaction with fiscal policy,
which dampens monetary policy in recessions but
reinforces it in expansions (Tenreyro and Thwaites
2016); or by changes in firms’ price-setting behavior
when inflation increases (Alvarez, Lippi, and Paciello
2011; Nakamura and Steinsson 2008; Albagli, Grigoli,
and Luttini 2023). Finally, cross-country synchronized
tightening can counteract global shocks, such as global
surges in commodity prices. Synchronization among
energy importers effectively lowers energy world
demand, hence reducing inflation faster (Auclert and
others 2022).
Overall, with today’s exceptionally synchronous
global monetary tightening, accompanied by widespread withdrawal of fiscal support, sharply increasing residential mortgage rates, and global financial
conditions highly sensitive to policy news, a shorter
transmission lag than in the past could occur in several
countries. Clear and effective communication by major
central banks regarding their resolve to keep inflation
expectations anchored and reduce inflation is expected
to further accelerate policy transmission.

CHAPTER 1

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.3. Risk Assessment Surrounding the World Economic Outlook Baseline Projections
This box uses the IMF’s Group of Twenty (G20)
Model to derive confidence bands around the World
Economic Outlook (WEO) growth and inflation forecasts
and to quantify a severe downside scenario. As in the
October 2022 WEO, the risk of global growth falling
below 2 percent in 2023—a low-growth outcome that
has happened only five other times (in 1973, 1981,
1982, 2009, and 2020) since 1970—remains elevated
at about 25 percent, with the balance of risks clearly
tilted to the downside. This box introduces inflation
confidence bands for the first time. The chance that core
inflation will be higher in 2023 than in 2022 is close to
30 percent. The downside scenario illustrates how shocks
to credit supply, stemming from banking sector fragility
in the face of tightening monetary policy and amplified
through risk-off behavior and a decline in confidence,
could reduce global growth to about 1 percent.

Confidence Bands
The methodology for producing confidence bands is
based on Andrle and Hunt (2020). The G20 Model,
presented in Andrle and others (2015), is used to
interpret historical data on output growth, inflation,
and international commodity prices and to recover
the implied economic shocks to aggregate demand
and supply. The recovered shocks are sampled through
nonparametric methods and fed back into the model
to generate predictive distributions around the WEO
projections. The resulting confidence bands thus depend
on the joint distribution of the estimated shocks, the
structure of the model, and the initial conditions for
the projections. Distributions for global variables are
obtained by aggregating country-level estimates.
In the October 2022 WEO, two versions of the
forecast distribution were presented: one that sampled
all historical data uniformly, that is, without judgment,
and one with judgment that sampled the year 1982
more heavily, to stress the risk of a more pronounced
slowdown from contractionary monetary policy. The
distribution is shown for the latter case (with judgment), as uncertainty about the impact of monetary
policy tightening remains central to the assessment of
risk. The judgment is applied to the first two years in
the projection horizon (2023 and 2024).
Figure 1.3.1 shows the distributions for global growth
and inflation projections. Each shade represents a
5 percentage point interval, and the entire band covers

90 percent of the distribution. Regarding global growth,
the added judgment makes the distribution skewed to
the downside, with lower growth outcomes more likely
than higher growth outcomes. There is a 70 percent
probability that 2023 global growth could be between
1.0 percent and 3.8 percent. Similarly, there is a 70 percent probability that growth will be between 1.4 percent
and 4.3 percent in 2024.
Regarding global inflation, there is a 70 percent
chance that 2023 headline inflation could be about
1.2 percentage points higher or lower than currently projected. The distribution for core inflation
is narrower: The range associated with a 70 percent
probability is 0.7 percentage point higher or lower
than the baseline. Both distributions are skewed to the
upside in the near term, but the skew is more notable
for core inflation, with about a 30 percent probability
that 2023 core inflation will exceed the 2022 level.
The upside skew for core in the near term reflects in
part the inflation surge seen during the COVID-19
period. Big positive shocks to inflation are now seen as
more likely than before the pandemic.

Risk Scenarios
Recent events have revealed greater-than-expected
fragility in parts of the global banking system, with
potential losses from the speed and magnitude of the
monetary policy tightening and the risk of deposit
withdrawals weighing on valuations and access to
funding. The IMF’s G20 Model is used to quantify a
severe downside scenario in which the overall supply
of credit is reduced and other channels add to the
impact on global activity. Each channel is presented as
a separate layer in the following discussion.
Layers
The first layer includes the impact from lower global
credit supply. Due to the stress on some banks’ balance
sheets, bank lending in the United States decreases by
4 percent in 2023 relative to current baseline projections, equivalent to about one-fifth of the contraction
in credit experienced during the global financial crisis
(relative to the precrisis trend). Corporate spreads
increase by 250 basis points in 2023. Other countries
also experience a shock to the supply of credit. For
euro area countries and Japan, the impact is similar
in magnitude to that for the United States; for other
countries, the size of the shock varies depending on
how their financial conditions correlate with those
in the United States. The assumed impact on China’s

28

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

domestic financial conditions is small. The tightening
in financial conditions is persistent and extends into
2024 and (to a lesser extent) beyond.
The macroeconomic effects are amplified through
three additional channels:
•• Equity prices: Global equity prices fall by
10 percent on impact and by about 6 percent on
average in 2023.
•• Flight to safety and dollar appreciation: In emerging
markets excluding Asia, sovereign premiums increase
considerably and the US dollar appreciates by close
to 10 percent. The shock for emerging market economies in Asia is about half as large, and China is
not directly affected. Sovereign spreads in some euro
area countries increase by a modest amount.
•• Fall in confidence: It is assumed that greater precautionary saving (about 75 percent of the estimated
increase in precautionary saving during the global
financial crisis) leads to a decrease in consumption,
while a decline in business sentiment leads to a
decrease in investment. For reference, in this layer,
US consumption and investment decrease by 0.3
and 1 percent, respectively, relative to the baseline.
The Policy Response
Monetary policy responds endogenously to the
resulting decrease in activity and inflationary pressures. In
terms of fiscal policy, it is assumed that automatic stabilizers operate in advanced economies but not in emerging
markets. Balance sheet policies and other interventions
by central banks and regulators, to preserve the stability
of the financial system, are not explicitly modeled but
should be thought of as helping avert a crisis, with larger
effects on activity than what is shown here. The potential
cost of these interventions and their impact on countries’
fiscal stance are not considered in this scenario. Should
fiscal policy, especially in countries with limited fiscal
space, tighten due to the strains on debt sustainability, the
macroeconomic impact would be larger.
Impact on World Output and Inflation
Figure 1.3.2 shows the effects of the scenario on the
level of GDP (in panel 1) and core inflation (panel 2)
for 2023 and 2024. Results are presented as percent
deviations from the baseline, for the case of GDP, and
percentage point deviations from the baseline, for the
case of core inflation. The contribution from each layer
(credit conditions, equity prices, dollar appreciation
and flight to safety, confidence) is shown in stacked
form in the figures. Country results are grouped into

CHAPTER 1

Global Prospects and Policies

Box 1.3 (continued)
four regions: the United States, advanced economies
excluding the United States, emerging markets excluding China, and China.
Results can be summarized as follows:
•• The credit conditions layer subtracts 0.5 percent
from global output in 2023. The impact of this
layer is larger in the United States and in other
advanced economies than in emerging markets. The
impact on China is small.
•• The appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis emerging market economies’ currencies and tightening in
emerging market (and some advanced) economies’
sovereign premiums subtract another 0.2 percent
globally in 2022. The effect is larger in emerging market economies, at –0.4 percent in 2023.
Advanced economies as a group are also affected
by the currency depreciation in emerging market
economies and lower global demand.
•• The decline in equity prices subtracts another
0.5 percent from global output in 2023, with a
somewhat larger impact in advanced economies
than in emerging markets.
•• The confidence layer subtracts 0.5 percent from global
activity in 2023, with advanced economies again
seeing a larger hit to activity than emerging markets.
•• The combined effect from all layers implies a
decrease in the level of global output of 1.8 percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024, relative to
the baseline. The overall effect on global output
is about one-fourth the size of the impact of the
global financial crisis during 2008–09. The United
States and other advanced economies see a broadly
similar hit to activity (1.8 percent in 2023).
Emerging market economies excluding China see an
even larger effect (–1.9 percent) due mainly to the
dollar appreciation layer, while China experiences a
smaller impact overall (–1.2 percent).
•• Oil prices fall by close to 15 percent in 2023
relative to the baseline, due to the decrease in global
demand, before gradually returning to the baseline
over the projection horizon.
•• The disinflationary impulse, shown in panel 2,
is pronounced. Global core inflation declines by
0.9 percentage point in 2023 and by 1.1 percentage
points in 2024, relative to the baseline. Disinflation
is more pronounced in emerging markets excluding

China, due to the assumption that Phillips curves
are steeper, but the decline in inflation is also sizable

•• Policy rates (not shown) are also considerably
lower in this scenario. US policy rates decline by
1.6 percentage points in 2023 and 1.8 percentage points in 2024, relative to the baseline; the
global average of policy rates declines by 2.1 and
2.3 percentage points over the same period.

Primary commodity prices declined 28.2 percent between
August 2022 and February 2023. The decrease was led
by energy commodities, down 46.4 percent. European
natural gas prices declined by 76.1 percent amid lower
consumption and high storage levels. Base and precious metal prices rebounded by 19.7 and 3.3 percent,
respectively, whereas food prices increased slightly, by
1.9 percent. This Special Feature analyzes the impact of
declines in the extraction of fossil fuel and other minerals
on the macroeconomic activity of commodity exporters.

Energy prices waver. Crude oil prices retreated by
15.7 percent between August 2022 and February 2023
as the slowing global economy weakened demand
(Figure 1.SF.1, panels 1 and 3). China experienced its
first annual decline in oil consumption this century
amid repeated shutdowns in response to COVID-19
outbreaks and a faltering real estate market. Recession
fears due to higher-than-expected inflation and tighter
monetary policy in many major economies and banking woes sparked concerns about flagging demand.
On the supply side, uncertainty over the effects of
Western sanctions on Russian crude oil exports whipsawed expectations about global market balances. As of
March, Russian crude oil exports had held steady since
implementation of the Group of Seven (G7) price cap
and ban on crude oil imports on December 5. Russia
rerouted its oil, reportedly sold at a major discount to
Brent oil prices, to nonsanctioning countries, primarily India and China. Downside supply risks did not
materialize until Russia’s recent announcement of a
modest production reduction. A sizable release of strategic petroleum reserves by Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development member countries also
helped keep oil markets well supplied, in part offsetting underproduction and reduced targets by OPEC+
(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
plus selected nonmember countries).

Futures markets suggest that crude oil prices will
slide by 24.1 percent, to average $73.1 a barrel, in
2023 (from $96.4 in 2022) and continue to fall in
the coming years, to $65.4 in 2026 (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 2). Uncertainty around this price outlook is elevated in part due to the uncertain rebound in China’s

Commodit y Special Feature  Market Developments and the Macroeconomic Impact of Declines in Fossil Fuel Extraction

growth, as well as the energy transition (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 3). Upside price risks stem from potential supply
disruptions, including those from Russian retaliation
to a binding price cap, and insufficient investment in
fossil fuel extraction. Following the financial market
turmoil that emerged in mid-March, downside price
risks of a widespread global economic relapse have
increased significantly.
Natural gas prices at the European Title Transfer
Facility trading hub receded 76.1 percent from record
highs in August 2022 to $16.7 a million British thermal units (MMBtus) in February 2023 as concerns
about supply shortages faded. Prices reached nearly
$100 a MMBtu in late August when EU countries
raced to refill their gas storage facilities amid fears
of supply shortages during the winter. This followed
Russia’s progressive shutdown of roughly 80 percent
of pipeline gas supplies to European countries. Prices
in the global liquefied natural gas market followed
in lockstep. For the winter of 2022–23, a crisis was
averted, with ample storage at European facilities
owing to higher liquefied natural gas imports and
lower gas demand amid high prices as well as an
atypically mild winter. Lower demand due to an economic slowdown in China and substitution of other
fuel sources, such as coal, also helped ease pressures
on the global liquefied natural gas market. A price
decline to historical averages is expected by 2028
(Figure 1.SF.2). Risks of price spikes remain somewhat elevated, however, for next winter. Spillovers
from gas markets caused a 50.9 percent slide in coal
prices over the reference period.
Metal prices recover after steep drop. The base metal
price index dropped below levels preceding Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine. It surged after the invasion
but experienced a broad-based retreat amid slowing Chinese metal demand (accounting for roughly
half of global consumption of major metals) and
monetary policy tightening. With China’s reopening
and increased infrastructure spending, as well as an
expected slower pace of interest rate hikes from the
Federal Reserve, base metal prices partially rebounded,
increasing by 19.7 percent from August 2022 to
February 2023. Recent banking distress presents
significant downside risks to prices. The IMF’s energy
transition metal index increased 14.3 percent. Gold
prices rose by 5.1 percent, and central banks’ net
purchases broke a 55-year record. The base metal price
index is projected to increase 3.5 percent in 2023 and

then decrease 2.6 percent in 2024. Traders seem to
price in a potential rebound in demand from China.
Agricultural prices continue on a downward trend.
Drawdowns of stocks of staple foods in major exporting countries, due to major shocks in the past two
years from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, have
stopped as supply and demand have reacted to higher
prices. Food and beverage prices peaked in May 2022
and are up 1.3 percent from last August. They remain
22.3 percent above the past-five-year average and
39.1 percent above pre-pandemic levels. The supply outlook improved as Ukrainian wheat and other
products entered the global market after the Black Sea
corridor initiative was renewed last November. High
prices also provided incentives to other regions, such
as the European Union and India, to step up wheat
production. However, some of the correction has likely
come from demand destruction of price-elastic components such as meat and biofuels. Risks remain balanced
as spillovers from gas to fertilizer prices and a possible
abrupt ending of the Black Sea corridor deal offset possibly reduced consumption and a potentially stronger
supply reaction. Prices of raw agricultural materials
declined by 9.1 percent from last August amid slowing
global demand but, like base metal prices, have partly
rebounded in recent months.

The Macroeconomic Impact of Declines in Fossil
Fuel Extraction
Reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will require
an 80 percent reduction in global fossil fuel extraction
compared with 2021 levels, according to the International Energy Agency (2022) (Figure 1.SF.3). Though
the situation is highly uncertain, it is worth asking
what economic repercussions a contraction in fossil
fuel extraction could have for fossil fuel exporters. A
large amount of literature emphasizes the negative
impact a sizable extraction industry has on a country’s economic growth (the resource curse) because
it weighs on the performance of the manufacturing
sector (Krugman 1987; Frankel 2012) and on the
quality of institutions (Mauro 1995; Lane and Tornell
1996).1 There is, however, a dearth of analysis on the
macroeconomic effects of a reversal, to the extent that
there is still debate over whether a decline in fossil fuel

1“Dutch disease” is a version of the resource curse in which an

increase in commodity prices leads to a real exchange rate appreciation that crowds out a commodity exporter’s domestic manufacturing sector. Total output can still expand, and the country can
become richer. See Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2008) and van der
Ploeg and Venables (2012).

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

production is detrimental or beneficial to countries’
economic growth.2
This Special Feature contributes to filling this gap
by estimating the macroeconomic impact of persistent declines in extraction activity.3 It focuses on
production declines, given that the effects of climate
policies on fossil fuel prices are uncertain, depending
on whether policies curbing demand for fossil fuels
will prevail over those curbing their supply (see the
April 2022 World Economic Outlook). Even though
production declines will likely vary substantially and
are hard to anticipate, these estimates can help inform
fossil-fuel-exporting countries’ medium- to long-term
planning and policies.
Countries depending on fossil fuel output: Between
2010 and 2019, average oil and gas production-to-GDP ratios were large in countries such as
Angola, Azerbaijan, the Republic of Congo, Kuwait,
and Saudi Arabia (Figure 1.SF.4 panel 1). Gas production is particularly relevant in Qatar and Trinidad
and Tobago. Coal production, on the other hand, is
less relevant to GDP at the country level, except in
the case of Mongolia. Most extracted fossil fuels are
exported and so are a fundamental source of cash
inflows in economies’ external balance. Indeed, ratios
of net exports of oil and gas to GDP surpassed 25
percent on average over 2010–2019 in more than
ten countries (Figure 1.SF.4 panel 2). The oil and gas
sector is also a substantial contributor to tax revenues
and, to a lesser extent, to employment (see Online
Annex Figures 1.SF.1 to 1.SF.4).4
A new data set on declines in extraction: The empirical exercise conducted for this Special Feature relies
on a new data set on the extraction of oil, coal, gas,
and metals for countries worldwide from 1950 to
2020. To deal with endogeneity, the analysis identifies
35 episodes involving persistent declines in extractive
activity out of a total of 154 observed episodes. It
verifies that these episodes are driven by factors exogenous to economic conditions such as depletion or
sector-specific policy changes. For example, included
are episodes such as the sudden tax increase on bauxite
mining in Suriname in 1974, which led to a ­persistent

contraction in bauxite output (other examples feature
in Bems and others, forthcoming). Extraction declines
driven by global recessions, policy decisions directly
affecting other sectors of an economy, and structural
transitions such as the breakup of the Soviet Union
and civil wars are excluded. Across those identified, the
typical episode is a 10 percent contraction in extraction
activity in the episode’s first year that cumulates to a
40 percent reduction over 10 years (Figure 1.SF.5).
Estimating the macroeconomic effects of declines in
extractive activity: Following Jordà (2005), local projections are used to estimate the effects of episodes of persistent exogenous extraction declines on real GDP and
the external and domestic sectors using the following:
​​y​ t+h,i​​  − ​y​ t−1,i​​  = α + ​β​​  h​ Δ ​q​ t,i​​  + ​∑ pj=1​​ ​Γ​  hj​  ​ ​y​ t−j,i​​ 

+ ​∑ pj=1​​ ​Π​  hj​  ​ Δ ​q​ t−j,i​​  + ​ψ​  n​​  + ​ϕ​  t​​  + ​u​ t+h,i​​ ​y​  t+h,i​​  − ​y​  t−1,i​​​.

The equation’s left side represents the log deviation
of the variable of interest from its initial value over

the horizon h, up to 10 years. Results may thus be
interpreted as cumulative percentage changes from the
baseline to a shock in year t. The term Δqt,i captures
the percentage change in extraction output for episode
i at year t. The baseline includes country fixed effects
ψn to account for structural differences across countries, time fixed effects ​​ϕ​  t​​​to control for global price
movements and other common global factors, as well
as three lags of the dependent variable, and a shock
series to deal with autocorrelation, following Montiel
Olea and Plagborg-Møller (2021).
Negative macroeconomic effects: A typical episode
leads to a 1 percent initial decline from the baseline in
real GDP, cumulating to 5 percent after five years. The
decline is persistent, with no rebound until the end of
the horizon (Figure 1.SF.6, panel 1).
The real exchange rate depreciates slowly by 20 percent. This does not stimulate enough reallocation of
production factors such as labor and capital toward
tradables sectors, which could offset the decline in
exports that depend on extractive industries. Instead,
the trade balance worsens, driven by a decline in
exports of about 6 percent (Figure 1.SF.6, panel 3).
Imports and investment also decline, though the
estimates for these effects are less precise. Aggregate
consumption responds only with a lag of more than
five years.
The role of manufacturing: Spillover effects on the
manufacturing and services sectors are significant
and negative. Their value added falls significantly by
about 5 percent (Bems and others, forthcoming).

These ­sectors provide mining sector inputs and process outputs. The negative impact more than offsets
the potential benefits of the depreciation in the real
exchange rate. The initial share of the manufacturing
sector in value added matters. Economies with bigger
initial manufacturing shares fare better, suggesting the
presence of sunk costs in the tradables sector that favor
existing exporting manufacturing firms over new ones.
The negative impact on employment is, on the other
hand, small, likely owing to the high capital intensity
of the extraction sector.

Figure 1.SF.7. Response of Institutional Quality Interacted
with Manufacturing Sector Size to an Extraction Decline
Shock

The role of institutions: The estimated GDP impact is
significantly larger for middle- and low-income countries than for those with high incomes. One plausible
explanation for this is that high-income countries tend
to have stronger institutions. Five years after the shock,
the GDP difference between countries with high and
low institutional quality is about 5 percentage points
(Figure 1.SF.6, panel 2). This could indicate that
strong institutions help buffer the negative economic
effects of a persistent decline in extraction activity.
While explaining what determines the quality of
institutions is beyond the scope of this analysis, the
economic literature on the resource curse emphasizes
that resource booms can lead to a deterioration in the
quality of institutions. What happens, however, in
the reverse, a resource extraction bust? The exercise
shows that a decline in extraction activity does not
restore the quality of institutions, not even a decade
after the shock. This suggests a hysteresis effect and an
asymmetric response of institutions to shocks: once
institutions are damaged, improving them is hard (see
Figure 1.SF.7).
Anticipation: It could bias the results toward a smaller
estimated impact if the regression does not capture
earlier adjustment. To explore anticipation, projections
of commodity production in IMF Article IV reports
are reviewed and compared with actual production.
Out of 26 decline episodes with Article IV coverage,

10

Commodit y Special Feature  Market Developments and the Macroeconomic Impact of Declines in Fossil Fuel Extraction

only 4 were anticipated. In the other 22, extraction was
expected either to increase or to remain stable (or in a
few cases, it was not mentioned). The lack of anticipation, in turn, suggests that uncertainty about the size
and persistence of the ensuing contraction may have
delayed the economic adjustment needed, surprising the
country’s policymakers and private sector alike. In fact,
both private and public consumption initially increase,
declining only with a delay to a 4 percent lower level.
This suggests that the shock was typically not fully
anticipated, or income-side policies are implemented
to buffer the initial impact, or both. Accordingly, the
exchange rate moves in only a modest and statistically
nonsignificant way.
A More Challenging Energy Transition: Countries
at risk of declining fossil fuel output need to address
the possibility of a challenging structural adjustment.
To do so, they can improve public finances and the
quality of their institutions (for example, by enhancing the management of public sector institutions
and the regulatory business environment), diversify
their economies (Cherif and others 2022), set up

sovereign wealth funds, and facilitate the reallocation of production factors. Possible policies for
accomplishing these goals include ameliorating the
business environment to attract investment in new,
productive, higher-value-added sectors; modernizing
infrastructure and attracting foreign direct investment
in research and development; and improving the
human capital stock of the labor force by investing
in education.
The pace and direction of the clean energy transition as well as the price outlook depend on the policy
mix. This creates great uncertainty in countries that
produce fossil fuels. If fossil fuel prices decline because
of a climate policy mix that works mostly through the
demand side, high-cost producers will need to shut
down production. If those prices instead rise based on
a climate policy mix that relies on supply cuts, local
production declines will depend on domestic policy
decisions (see the Special Feature in the April 2022
World Economic Outlook). Climate policy certainty, at
the country and global levels, could make adjustments
more predictable and less costly.

THE NATURAL RATE OF INTEREST: DRIVERS AND
IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY

The natural rate of interest—the real interest rate
that neither stimulates nor contracts the economy—is
important for both monetary and fiscal policy; it is a
reference level to gauge the stance of monetary policy
and a key determinant of the sustainability of public
debt. This chapter aims to study the evolution of the
natural rate of interest across several large advanced and
emerging market economies. To mitigate the uncertainty
that typically surrounds estimates of the natural rate, the
chapter relies on complementary approaches to analyze
its drivers and project its future path. Common trends
such as demographic changes and productivity slowdown
have been key factors in the synchronized decline of the
natural rate. And while international spillovers have been
important determinants of the natural rate, offsetting
forces have resulted in only a moderate impact on balance.
Overall, the analysis suggests that once the current
inflationary episode has passed, interest rates are likely to
revert toward pre-pandemic levels in advanced economies.
How close interest rates get to those levels will depend on
whether alternative scenarios involving persistently higher
government debt and deficit or financial fragmentation
materialize. In major emerging market economies, natural
interest rates are expected to gradually converge from
above toward advanced economies’ levels. In some cases,
this may ease the pressure on fiscal authorities over the
long term, but fiscal adjustments will still be needed in
many countries to stabilize or reduce debt-to-GDP ratios.

Introduction
In 1979, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates
from about 10 percent at the start of the year to
almost 14 percent by the year’s end, which in real
terms—after taking account of inflation—amounted to
a rate of interest of about 5 percent.1 Even at the time

1When comparing interest rates, it is important to take account
of inflation. Savings invested at 5 percent when inflation is 2 percent
will buy the same thing as an investment at 3 percent when inflation is zero.

this was viewed as likely insufficient to tame rapidly
rising inflation.2 And so it proved to be. Inflation
continued to rise, peaking at nearly 15 percent the
following year, requiring even higher interest rates and
a prolonged recession before the situation was brought
under control.
Nearly three decades later as the world faced the
global financial crisis of 2008, the Federal Reserve—
along with central banks worldwide—slashed interest
rates to as close to zero as they thought possible in
nominal and real terms. This time around, however,
commentators and policymakers raised concerns that
interest rates were not low enough to boost demand
and inflation. Once again, these concerns proved
well-founded, with inflation remaining stubbornly low
for much of the next 10 years.
These two contrasting examples raise an obvious
question. How can it be that in the same country a
real interest rate of 5 percent is sometimes too low but
at other times a real interest rate of zero is too high?
Most answers rely on the idea that a given real
interest rate does not have the same macroeconomic
effects at all times. Instead, the impact is relative to
some reference level. When real interest rates are below
that level, they are stimulatory, boosting demand and
inflation. And when above it, they are contractionary,
lowering output and inflation. If this reference level
moves over time, then the same real interest rate can
be too high or too low at different times.
Macroeconomists call this reference interest rate
the “real natural rate of interest.”3 The “natural” part
means that this is the real interest rate that is neither
stimulatory nor contractionary and is consistent with
output at potential and stable inflation. Lowering the
real rate below the natural rate is akin to stepping on
the macroeconomic accelerator; raising it above is like
hitting the brake. The natural rate is usually thought of
as independent of monetary policy and instead driven
2See Goodfriend and King (2005).

3In many discussions, the “real” part is dropped; this approach is
followed in the chapter. Some economists use the terms “neutral”
and “natural” interchangeably, and some do not. For clarity, this
chapter uses only “natural.”

by real phenomena such as, for instance, technological
progress, demographics, inequality, or preference shifts
for safe and liquid assets.4
As the preceding discussion suggests, the natural
rate is important for the conduct of monetary policy.
Policymakers need to know the level of the natural
rate in order to gauge the likely impact of their policies and so assess the stance of monetary policy. The
natural rate also has a critical influence on fiscal policy. On average over the long term, monetary policy is
typically neither inflationary nor contractionary. And
so the natural rate is also an anchor for real rates over
long periods of time. Because governments typically
pay back debts over long time spans (both through
long-maturity debt and by rolling over short-term
debt), the natural rate is essential in determining the
overall cost of borrowing and the sustainability of
public debts.
Given the importance of the natural rate for both
monetary and fiscal policy, it is not surprising that
the recent surge in inflation and government debt
worldwide has led to renewed interest in this topic.
Real rates have increased a bit as monetary policy has
become tighter in response to higher inflation. But
the uptick remains modest compared with the late
1970s. Whether central banks have raised rates enough
to return inflation to target depends critically on the
level of the natural rate. Similarly, the natural rate will
determine how much of a burden the present-day high
levels of debt will be for governments (see Chapter 3).
In light of these concerns, the chapter seeks to
answer the following questions:
•• How has the natural rate evolved in the past across
different economies?
•• What has driven this evolution?
•• What is the outlook for these drivers and natural
rates in the near and medium term?
•• How will this outlook affect monetary and
fiscal policies?
To shed light on these issues, the chapter first reviews
the main stylized facts that characterize real interest
rate trends at different maturities and across different
countries. It then sets out to measure the natural rate.
To mitigate the unavoidable uncertainty associated with
estimations of the natural rate, the chapter will follow
4In line with a long tradition in monetary economics, monetary
policy is here assumed to be neutral, meaning that it does not affect real
variables over the long term. Borio, Disyatat, and Rungcharoenkitkul
(2019) present an alternative view and implications for the natural rate.

a two-pronged approach. Beginning with a simple
model (Laubach and Williams 2003)—one that lets the
data speak—it moves to a tighter theoretical structure
that imposes more restrictions on the data but allows a
deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of the
natural rate (Platzer and Peruffo 2022). Comparing
estimates from different models provides independent
validation. In addition, alternative scenarios covering
a range of plausible future developments for the main
underlying drivers of the natural rate are considered
for robustness. These projections provide a long-term
anchor for monetary policy and a crucial input to
analyze debt sustainability in the largest advanced and
emerging market economies.
The main findings of the chapter are as follows:
•• Common trends have played an important role in
driving real interest rates down. The natural rate
has declined over the past four decades in most
advanced economies and some emerging markets.
While idiosyncratic factors can explain cross-country
differences, common trends underlying demographic
transitions and productivity slowdowns are key to
understanding the synchronized decline.
•• Global drivers have also been important determinants
but on balance have had a limited impact on net capital flows and corresponding natural rates in advanced
and emerging market economies. As global capital
markets opened and fast-growing emerging market
economies entered the scene in the 1980s and
1990s, foreign factors increasingly shaped long-term
trends in interest rates. High growth in emerging
markets has tended to drive up interest rates in
advanced economies while producing a glut of
savings in emerging markets. These excess savings—
in their quest for safe and liquid assets—have tended
to flow back to advanced economies, pushing
natural interest rates back down. On balance, these
forces seem to have had broadly offsetting effects on
capital flows and a moderate impact on natural rates
over the past half-century.
•• Country-specific natural rates of interest are projected
to converge in the next couple of decades. Based on
conservative assumptions on demographic, fiscal,
and productivity developments, it is anticipated that
natural rates in large emerging market economies
will decline, gradually converging toward the low
and steady levels expected in advanced economies.
•• As inflation returns to target, the effective lower
bound on interest rates may become binding again.
Post-pandemic increases in interest rates could be

CHAPTER 2

The Natural Rate of Interest: Drivers and Implications for Policy

protracted until inflation is brought back to target
(Chapter 1). However, long-term forces driving
the natural rate suggest that interest will eventually
converge toward pre-pandemic levels in advanced
economies. How close to those levels will depend on
whether alternative scenarios involving persistently
higher government debt and deficit or financial
fragmentation materialize. Because nominal rates
cannot fall far below zero (the effective lower bound
constraint), this could limit central banks’ ability to
respond to negative demand shocks. Thus, debates
about the appropriate level of target inflation at
the effective lower bound could reemerge. Even the
central banks in some emerging market economies
may eventually need to adopt unconventional policy
tools similar to those used by advanced economies
in recent years.
•• Despite increased fiscal space, many countries will
have to consolidate. While low natural rates may
ease pressure on fiscal policy, they do not negate
the need for fiscal responsibility. Important government support during the pandemic has strained
public accounts, requiring some budget consolidation to ensure long-term debt sustainability.
Various paths to deficit reduction are open, but
delaying action will only make the required steps
more drastic: Larger public debt tends to crowd
out private investment and erode the appeal of safe
and liquid government debt.

Trends in Real Rates over the Long Term
This section lays out some basic facts about how real
interest rates have evolved over the long term. Because
the natural rate is an anchor for real interest rates,
long-term trends in real interest rates are potentially
informative signals about the natural rate itself.
Figure 2.1, panel 1, starts the inquiry by comparing
five different measures of the ex ante real interest rate
for the United States.5 Different maturities from 1 year
up to 20 years are considered. Despite differences at
high frequencies—the short-horizon measures are
5Ex ante measures of the real interest rate use actual measures of

inflation expectations, which are either extracted from financial markets or based on surveys, to deflate the nominal interest rate. Ex post
real interest rates rely instead on realized inflation. Over long periods
of time, ex ante and ex post real interest rates tend to coincide, but
there can be large discrepancies when surprise inflation is expected to
be temporary, as in the most recent episode. Unfortunately, inflation
expectation measures are not always available for long time series,
emerging markets, or both.

unsurprisingly much more volatile—all these measures
share a common long-term trend. Looking through
cyclical fluctuations and term premiums, real rates
have fallen steadily, by about 5 percentage points over
the last four decades across all maturities. Given that
the natural rate of interest is a long-term attractor for
real rates, this suggests that the natural rate of interest
has also fallen, at least in the United States.
To get a sense of whether these developments have
been mirrored elsewhere, Figure 2.1, panel 2, compares
historical ex post real rates in five advanced economies
over a similar period, in this case using three-month
real rates. The broad pattern is the same, with real
rates declining steadily from highs in the 1980s.
Interestingly, the common international component
seems at first glance to have become more important
over time, with countries’ real rates seeming to converge gradually.

weights. Maturity of the bonds is greater than one year. Nominal interest rates are
deﬂated using consumer price inﬂation.

This section relies on well-known macroeconomic
empirical models to try to estimate the natural rate
of interest. Because the natural rate is an unobserved,
latent variable, any measurement requires some theory.
The approach here is to use a minimal amount of
theory, drawing on simple macroeconomic relationships between aggregate supply and demand, interest
rates, and inflation. Approaches based on aggregate
relationships are a good starting point for developing
a more informed measure of the natural rate because
they are transparent and straightforward. Subsequent
sections use a richer framework based on more extensive microeconomic theory and so speak more to the
underlying drivers of the natural rate.

Single-Country Estimates of the Natural Rate
Figure 2.2 contrasts developments in advanced and
emerging market economies. A shared trend at the
start of the 2000s decoupled later on as real rates continued to decline in advanced economies but stabilized
at their 2005 level in emerging markets.
Overall, this first look at the data suggests that
the natural rate has likely declined in the past four
decades or so in advanced economies. This downward
trend seems to be increasingly common across countries and points to some global drivers. The picture
is different in emerging markets, where natural rates
have remained broadly stable over the past 20 years
on average. Because emerging market and advanced
economies’ current accounts are broadly balanced,
the divergence in long-term rates points to remaining
frictions preventing a stronger convergence between
advanced and emerging market economies (Obstfeld
2021).6 Yet this analysis leaves many important issues
unaddressed. The data, although suggesting that the
natural rate has declined in many advanced economies,
6Beyond market frictions, weak institutions and lack of investor
protection in recipient countries may also explain the lack of
convergence. An alternative explanation, which is likely to be
particularly relevant for the United States, is that following the
global financial crisis, emerging market debt was not considered
safe, pushing down the real interest rate for the main provider of
safe and liquid assets.

48

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

The first approach is an application of the widely
used Laubach-Williams model (Holston, Laubach, and
Williams 2017; hereafter HLW). This model assumes
a set of relationships between supply, demand, interest
rates, and prices consistent with perhaps the most
standard macroeconomic view of the world, the New
Keynesian model.7 In this setting, the natural rate is
driven by a variety of shocks, including trend output
growth. Here, it is defined as the real interest rate that
will return output to potential and inflation to target,
once purely transitory shocks to aggregate supply or
demand have dissipated. The intuition for this is that
central banks tend to think about returning inflation
to target in the medium term, because trying to offset
every temporary shock would lead to undue volatility
in interest rates and output.8

7See Online Annex 2.2 for a formal description of the model. All

online annexes are available at www​.imf​.org/​en/​Publications/​WEO.
8In this framework, financial shocks affect the natural rate only if
they affect potential output. A persistent increase in precautionary
saving or preference for safe and liquid assets would qualify, whereas
purely transitory variation in risk aversion, for example, would not
(Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi 2014; Gourinchas, Rey, and Sauzet
2022). This definition of the natural rate is consistent with the one
implicit in the theoretical framework of the next section, because it
emphasizes low-frequency movements of the real interest rate in a
world without nominal friction (where output is at potential).

CHAPTER 2

The Natural Rate of Interest: Drivers and Implications for Policy

The model is first estimated from data for one
country at a time. As part of the estimation, the model
attempts to figure out what were the most likely
values for several key unobserved variables, including
potential output and the natural rate of interest, given
the (relatively standard) New Keynesian view of the
macroeconomy. This framework also offers a basic
decomposition of changes in the natural rate into two
components: one due to changes in the long-term
growth trend, and one due to other factors, which
can in principle include domestic and foreign drivers.
One drawback, however, is that the HLW model is
designed to apply principally to advanced economies,
for which data can be reasonably described by the
New Keynesian model over a long enough time period.
The richer structural model in the next section has
more to say about emerging markets.
Figure 2.3 summarizes the results from estimating
the HLW model on a sample of six advanced economies for which sufficient quarterly data exist. It shows
estimates of the natural rate, as well as the part due to
trend growth, for two five-year periods: one covering
the end of the 1970s, the other for the late 2010s.
These estimates broadly confirm the intuition presented so far in this chapter: that the natural rate of
interest has declined across advanced economies in the
past 40 years. Despite some variation in the level of the
rate across countries, the magnitude of the decline has
been broadly similar, at a little over 2 percentage points
in most countries. This is much smaller than the overall decline in real interest rates over the same period (of
about 5 percentage points), which likely also reflected
the change in the monetary policy stance, particularly
tight at the beginning of the 1980s as central banks
fought historically high inflation.
However, the uncertainty over the estimates of the
natural rate is very large, with the 90 percent confidence interval for the United States ranging from zero
to about 3 percent in the second half of the 2010s.
Uncertainty is a common feature of all estimates of
the natural rate9 and arises because the estimated
­relationships between interest rates and the output gap,
and the output gap and inflation, are both relatively
weak. As a result, fluctuations in output and inflation
provide little information about the overall level of the
natural rate. Yet at least one part of the natural rate
is well estimated: the trend growth component, for

which confidence intervals are much smaller. This is
because data for output are directly informative about
trend growth.
One interesting feature of these results is that the
decline in the natural rate is so similar across advanced
economies despite such differing trend growth components. With the exception of Japan, the natural rate
dropped more than implied by the change in growth
rates over the same period. This suggests that some
forces other than domestic growth may be inducing

common movements in the natural rate. That estimated natural rates are more similar across countries
now than 40 years ago is perhaps consistent with the
idea that capital market integration has progressed,
at least among advanced economies. This possibility
motivates an extended version of this model, which
allows for explicit international spillovers through
either real or financial channels (and is explored in the
section “Multicountry Estimates of the Natural Rate”).

The Natural Rate during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Despite its limitation, the closed economy model is
a useful benchmark for addressing two questions that
have gained attention during the post-pandemic inflationary episode in many advanced economies. That
is: How much did policymakers stimulate during the
pandemic? And how fast did they tighten afterward?
One concern when answering these questions is
that any conclusions may unduly rely on the benefit of hindsight. What now might appear to be
policy mistakes may have been perfectly reasonable
decisions for policymakers without the benefit of
perfect foresight.
To illustrate the challenges, Figure 2.4 shows
different vintages of measures of the real and natural
rates. The gap between the two is a summary measure
of whether monetary policy is tight (when the realized
real rate is higher than the natural rate; the gap is positive) or loose (when the gap is negative). The measures
differ in the data they use. The full-sample estimate (in
red) uses data up to the third quarter of 2022 and so
approximates the current best guess of what the natural
rate was at each point in time. This helps provide an
assessment of the monetary policy stance with the
benefit of hindsight. In contrast, contemporaneous
estimates (in blue) are computed by repeatedly running
the model, extending the data sample by one quarter
each time. This aims to approximate how the real rate
gap might have been assessed at the time.
Early in the pandemic, the two measures differed,
often considerably and usually with the contemporaneous estimate presenting a much tighter view of
monetary policy. This is consistent with the idea that
the shocks seen when the pandemic hit were highly
unusual, with both supply and demand moving far
and fast. Faced with contemporaneous data, this model
viewed supply shocks as having a large permanent
component, generating an exceptionally low natural rate and thus a tight stance for monetary policy.

Subsequent data helped correct this misperception,
with the sharp change in the natural rate early in the
pandemic progressively revised away. A reasonable
interpretation is that policymakers looked through the
immediate crisis, applied their judgment in a way that

CHAPTER 2

a model cannot, and so delivered moderately stimulatory policy.10
Later in the pandemic, however, policy became
looser. And although the natural rate did rise a little in
most places, looser policy largely came about through
inflation eroding real policy rates. In contrast to the
early pandemic period, the red and blue dots are
generally very close. This says that subsequent data do
not tell us much that was not known at the time. And
so, while policymakers may have had good reasons not
considered here for conservatism in adjusting rates,
the HLW model suggests that policy was loose for a
long time in some countries (October 2022 Global
Financial Stability Report).

One drawback of the HLW approach is that it
involves a closed-economy model; it can only estimate
the natural rate for one country at a time. This is not
an issue when the goal is only to estimate the level of
the natural rate in a particular country. However, the
approach cannot be used for counterfactual analysis that
would try to assess something like the impact of a decline
in foreign potential growth on the domestic natural rate.
One way to address this is to use an explicitly international model. Wynne and Zhang (2018) proposed
one such framework that allows for two-way interactions between two independent regions using an empirical approach very similar to HLW. The framework
features an important general equilibrium aspect of the
determination of the natural rate via international spillovers. This is in line with international macroeconomic
theory that stipulates that when capital is internationally mobile, the determination of natural rates entails
a global dimension (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler 2002;
Galí and Monacelli 2005; Metzler 1951; Obstfeld
2020). This also implies that if there are spillovers from
one country to another, then it stands to reason that
those effects might spill back over to the originator.
Specifically, the natural rate is now allowed to be
affected not just by domestic growth but also by
foreign growth. The intuition is that if foreign growth
increases, so do foreign rates of return, necessitating
greater compensation for domestic investors and driving up the domestic natural rate. Of course, changes
in the domestic natural rate affect domestic growth,

how to adapt the HLW model to capture the pandemic.

which then spills back to the foreign natural rate
through a similar channel.
Figure 2.5 presents the results from such a model,
with the United States and the rest of the world as
the two regions.11 As before, this setting suggests that
the natural rate in the United States has declined
by about 2 percentage points in the past 50 years or
so. In contrast, the estimated natural rate in the rest
of the world has been more stable, at least since the
mid-1970s. Two factors are responsible. First, as might
be expected, domestic growth rather than foreign
growth is more important for each (relatively closed)
region. Second, secular slowdown in many advanced

by current account data, and so the decomposition may lump various effects together. Moreover, large confidence bands suggest that
inference is highly imprecise.

economies is offset by the rise of high-growth emerging market and developing economies, such as China,
propping up growth in the rest of the world. These
elements working together have led to a higher and
more stable natural rate outside the United States.
Nevertheless, international spillovers are significant
and important for determining the level of the natural
rate. The analysis suggests two offsetting channels. The
first operates through overseas growth (in red), which
has helped support the natural rate in the United
States. The other channel is shown by the increasing
and negative impact of “other factors” (in yellow).
That this has had a long-lasting and negative effect
on the natural rate in the United States is consistent
with the idea that increased foreign demand for safe
and liquid US assets has depressed returns (Bernanke
2005; Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008, 2016,
2017b; Pescatori and Turunen 2015), especially since
the global financial crisis. Note that the converse effect
in the rest of the world is smaller, which reflects the
relative sizes of the two regions.
Overall, this analysis suggests that foreign developments likely have had two offsetting effects on
natural rates in the United States. Sustained growth in
emerging markets has driven up the US interest rate
while simultaneously producing a glut of savings that
pulled it down again as foreign investors increasingly
demanded safe and liquid US government debt.
While more general than a closed economy model,
this framework still has an important drawback. It has
little to say about the true drivers of the changes in
the natural rate: What causes growth, either foreign
or domestic? What is behind “other factors”? The next
section tackles some of these questions.

Drivers of the Natural Rate
The aggregate macroeconomic models of the preceding sections can offer a very simple explanation for
why the natural rate has declined: While other factors
do play a role, growth—both foreign and domestic—
seems to be the most important factor. But this is
not very satisfying. “Growth” is a result of different
macroeconomic forces, not a primary force itself. For
example, while both demographic forces and productivity growth could be responsible for the secular
decline in growth, each could have potentially very
different implications for the natural rate. Moreover,
these deeper forces may have offsetting effects not fully
captured by this simple decomposition.

Some Theory
Many possible economic mechanisms have been proposed to explain variations in the natural interest rate.
Their importance can vary at different frequencies, with
“macroeconomic” forces more likely to drive long-term
trends and “financial” forces more likely to be important in the short to medium term, reflecting risk aversion and leveraging cycles.12 Of course, this distinction
is somewhat artificial because financial forces may drive
secular shifts in behavior that determines saving rates.13
Macroeconomic Drivers
•• Productivity growth: The simplest macroeconomic
theories dictate that the interest rate is pinned down
by growth in aggregate productivity. The idea is that
the rate of interest paid by a borrower must compensate the lender for giving up on alternative use
of those funds, known as their “opportunity cost.”
Higher productivity growth increases the marginal
product of capital and drives up savers’ opportunity
cost, necessitating a higher interest rate to induce
them to lend (Cesa-Bianchi, Harrison, and Sajedi
2022; Mankiw 2022; Solow 1956).
•• Demographics: Changes in fertility and mortality
rates have complex and time-varying effects on the
natural rate. Demographic forces have implications
for the economy’s growth rate, its dependency ratio,
and aggregate desired saving for longer retirement
(Auclert and others 2021; Carvalho, Ferrero, and
Nechio 2016; Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido
2021; see Online Annex 2.3).
•• Fiscal policy: Increased government borrowing can
lead to higher interest rates because more saving is
required to meet the increased demand for funds.
However, the extent to which this occurs also
depends on how much private investment is displaced
by the additional public debt (Eggertsson, Mehrotra,
and Robbins 2019; Rachel and Summers 2019).
•• Market power and the labor share: The impact of
increased market power on the natural rate is ambiguous. Increased market power typically depresses future
production and investment demand, weighing down
on interest rates. But it also reroutes dividends from
laborers to capital owners, with the impact on the
12See also Rogoff, Rossi, and Schmelzing (2021) for an analysis of

real rate dynamics over the past 700 years.

(2022) for recent reviews and Online Annex 2.3 for detailed description of the theoretical channels.

CHAPTER 2

natural rate depending on the distribution of these
dividends across cohorts (Ball and Mankiw 2021;
Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2017b; Eggertsson,
Mehrotra, and Robbins 2019; Mankiw 2022; Natal
and Stoffels 2019; Platzer and Peruffo 2022).
•• Other reasons: These include the effect of government taxation on the profile of private consumption
and saving (Eggertsson, Mehrotra, and Robbins
2019; Platzer and Peruffo 2022), rising inequality
increasing the overall supply of savings because rich
people tend to save more than poor people (Mian,
Straub, and Sufi 2021a, 2021b, 2021c), and potential interactions between different channels.
Financial Drivers
•• International capital flows and the scarcity of safe
assets: International spillovers from the integration
of global capital markets may have been powerful
drivers of the natural rate. Two main mechanisms
are at work. On one hand, high-growth emerging
markets provide alternative investment opportunities, resulting in capital outflows and raising
the natural rate in advanced economies (Clarida,
Galí, and Gertler 2002; Galí and Monacelli 2005;
Obstfeld and Rogoff 1997; Obstfeld 2021). On
the other hand, the supply of safe and liquid assets,
primarily US government bonds, has not kept pace
with fast-rising demand, especially from emerging
markets. Their ensuing scarcity may have driven
up their price and lowered their return (Bárány,
Coeurdacier, and Guibaud 2018; Bernanke 2005;
Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008, 2016,
2017a, 2017b, 2021; Del Negro and others 2017;
Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen 2012).
•• Risk aversion and leverage cycles: The quality attributed
to particularly safe and liquid assets (for example,
government bonds in advanced economies) gives rise
to a convenience yield, which is variable and likely
to increase when global stress leads to deleveraging
(Gourinchas, Rey, and Sauzet 2022). Given the safe
haven property of the US dollar, this is especially the
case for US Treasurys whose value increases in periods
of stress, providing protection to risk-averse international investors (Gourinchas, Rey, and Govillot 2017).

A New Theoretical Framework
To compare the quantitative impact of these different forces, this chapter relies on a macroeconomic
model (PP) based on Platzer and Peruffo (2022).

This is an important novelty with respect to earlier
literature because the PP model includes in one unified
framework many of the mechanisms discussed in the
previous section and so can explain how the contributions from each of the corresponding economic
forces change the natural rate. This approach avoids
double-counting and having to infer the importance of each driver from different models calibrated
separately.14
PP is a “real” macroeconomic model, in the sense
that it abstracts from nominal and financial frictions
that typically underlie cyclical fluctuations. Similarly,
for tractability, uncertainty is assumed away. While
these are reasonable assumptions for the study of
medium- to long-term trends in the real interest rate,
the model is ill-equipped to analyze the impact of the
financial drivers discussed earlier.15 Nonetheless, PP
still allows for foreign developments to affect domestic
interest rates through their implication for net international capital flows.
PP is calibrated to represent eight major global
economies: the United States, Japan, Germany, the
United Kingdom, France, China, India, and Brazil.
These are the five largest advanced economies and the
three largest emerging market and developing economies, which cover some 70 percent of global GDP.
Demographic developments, the age-earning profile,
the share of income going to the richest 10 percent,
productivity trends, the retirement age, average pension replacement rates, labor share, government debt,
and public expenditure inform the country-specific
calibrations.
Before turning to detailed model simulations,
Figure 2.6 compares the overall decline in the natural
rate implied by the PP and HLW frameworks. The
striking similarity between the results obtained with two
very different approaches is reassuring. This mitigates
the uncertainty surrounding HLW point estimates while
bolstering confidence in the microeconomic structure of
the PP framework.
The first exercise for this model is to understand
why the natural rate has declined in the past several
decades. Figure 2.7 presents the estimated change in
the natural rate and its attribution to the different
fundamental forces for each of the eight countries.
14Full details of the model are in Platzer and Peruffo (2022).
A description of specific calibration and simulations is in
Online Annex 2.3.

impact of variations in the convenience yield.

While no factor clearly dominates over the past
40 years, a set of common forces has driven the natural
rate, explaining part of the international comovement.
All eight countries in the sample experienced
population aging contributing negatively to the change
in the natural rate. This effect was particularly large
in China, Japan, and Germany. Growth in total factor
productivity (TFP) declined in all advanced economies,

at times explaining far more than the final decline in
the natural rate. Fiscal policy is an important offset in
all economies, particularly Japan and Brazil. In Japan,
public debt increased by more than 200 percent of
GDP, lifting the natural rate by more than the negative
contributions from TFP growth or demographics.
In Brazil, it is mainly the large increase in public
consumption, financed by taxation, that explains the
positive contribution of the fiscal driver, even though
the increase in public debt also plays a role. The
contribution of net international capital flows, which
summarizes the net impact of global forces through
international spillovers (discussed in the context of
Figure 2.5), is significant but smaller and goes in the
expected direction.16 The largest net negative effect
is found in the United States, potentially reflecting
that stockpiling of safe assets by emerging markets
more than offsets capital outflows drawn to attractive
investment opportunities abroad. In contrast, in Japan,
capital outflows seem to dominate, lifting the country’s
natural rate as excess domestic savings are invested in
faster-growing economies abroad. The picture is more
mixed in the three large emerging markets displayed
16Note that while gross capital flows have increased over time as
capital accounts have liberalized, both in- and outflows have surged
since the 1970s.

The Outlook for the Natural Rate

So far, this chapter has focused on understanding
what has happened to the natural rate and why. While
interesting, this is perhaps less relevant for policy today
than a slightly different issue: What will happen to real
rates in the future?

2

The Baseline
The same framework used to understand the
drivers of the natural rate can also be used to convert
assumptions about those underlying drivers into predictions for the natural rate. The baseline projection
presented in Figure 2.8, panel 1, relies on conservative assumptions for the main drivers: (1) predicted
demographic trends follow United Nations population
projections, (2) public debt follows World Economic
Outlook (WEO) projections until 2028 (and remains
constant thereafter), and (3) all other drivers are
assumed fixed at their 2015–19 levels. In emerging
markets, (4) TFP growth is assumed to converge to
the advanced economies’ average over the long term,
as would be expected as countries get closer to the
technology frontier.
The simulation suggests that natural interest rates
are likely to stay close to pre-pandemic levels in
advanced economies. Because the demographic transition is already well underway, the residual negative
impact of further aging is expected to be moderate.
At the same time, higher public debt acts as a counterweight, pushing up the natural rate. In emerging
markets, in contrast, the prognosis is for a significant
decline in natural rates. This is the consequence of
slowing productivity growth and an aging population;
in many emerging market economies, the demographic transition should accelerate in the decades
ahead. In China, for example, a steady decline in the
17There are also country-specific forces that drive idiosyncratic
movements in the natural rate. For example, the rise in inequality
during the past half-century has had a large negative impact on
the natural rate in the United States, even more than demographic
changes. Rising inequality is also relevant in India and Japan. The
change in market power is significant for India, which has experienced a large decline in the labor share over recent decades, implying
a corresponding rise in market power in this chapter’s model.
Online Annex 2.3 provides further explanation.

natural rate by about 1.5 percentage points within
the next 30 years is projected, bringing it to about
zero in 2050.
These projections assume that some degree of
segmentation remains between the capital markets
of advanced economies and emerging markets (see
Figure 2.2 and the analysis in Obstfeld 2021) and that
the balance of capital inflows and outflows stays as it
was in 2019.
Departures from these assumptions are used to craft
alternative scenarios.

Alternative Scenarios
The outlook for a given scenario is highly uncertain.
Many shocks could cause the natural rate to depart
from the baseline paths. And so these paths should
be thought of as illustrative, with a distribution of
future outcomes around them. Within this uncertain
outlook, some specific alternative scenarios stand out
International Monetary Fund | April 2023

55

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

as particularly germane to the current post-pandemic
conjuncture. (1) Government debt could drift higher,
(2) enthusiasm for holding safe and liquid public
debt could wane, (3) workers’ bargaining power could
increase, (4) deglobalization forces could intensify,
and (5) the energy transition could have important
implications for global saving, investment, and the
natural rate. These alternative scenarios are reported
in Figure 2.8, panel 2, and in Boxes 2.1 and 2.2 and
are described briefly here. All in all, deviations are
expected to be relatively modest, spanning a range
of about 120 basis points centered on the baseline
scenario. Of course, more sizable effects could be envisioned should combinations of these scenarios happen
simultaneously.
•• Higher government debt: As households struggle
to keep up with rising energy expenses and the
ongoing impact of the pandemic, governments may
opt to provide greater financial assistance. Allowing
public debt to increase by 25 percent of GDP above
the baseline by 2050 would increase demand for
private savings and lift the natural rate; however, the
impact should not exceed 5 to 10 basis points for
most countries.18
•• Erosion of the convenience yield, leading to higher
borrowing costs for government in advanced
economies: If investors were to perceive advanced
economies’ government debt as less safe and less
liquid than in the past (for example, if the US
Congress failed to raise the debt ceiling), then the
premium they pay for holding this particular type
of asset would erode as portfolios are rebalanced;
in this scenario, it is assumed that the premium
would return to pre-2000 average levels.19 This
decline in the convenience yield over the next three
decades would bring up natural rates in advanced

18The only channel modeled here is the effect of higher
demand for loanable funds from the public sector lifting the
equilibrium interest rate. Higher public debt could in principle
also erode the convenience yield, with a significant effect on
sustainability. This is considered explicitly in the next section,
“Policy Implications.”
19By considering yield spreads between safe and liquid government bonds and the highest-quality corporate bonds, the chapter
focuses here on the spread that most closely reflects the notion
that the convenience yield measures the unique safety and liquidity
characteristics of a government bond (Del Negro and others
2017). Other possibilities include yield spreads with lower-quality
corporate bonds or the equity risk premium (Caballero, Farhi, and
Gourinchas 2017b).

56

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

economies (and lower corporate bond yields) by
about 70 basis points.20
•• Higher labor shares in advanced economies: Markups
have increased in the past several decades, raising
the share of income going to capital owners at the
expense of workers (Akcigit and others 2021). As
workers’ bargaining power continues to improve
following the post-pandemic transformation of the
labor market, a return to labor shares prevailing in
the mid-1970s in advanced economies would raise
the natural rate by 6 to 19 basis points by 2050.
•• Energy transition: Transitioning to a cleaner and
more sustainable global economy by 2050, as
laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate
change, would push global natural rates lower in
the medium term because higher energy prices
bring down the marginal productivity of capital
and investment demand. For reasonable scenarios
based on the October 2020 WEO, the effects are
expected to be relatively modest: By 2050, natural
rates are expected to decline by 50 basis points
along a hump-shaped trajectory. If large investment
in low-emission capital and technology is financed
through budget deficits, natural rates could temporarily climb by 30 basis points (Box 2.1).
•• Deglobalization: With increasing geopolitical tensions, the risk of some form of international trade
fragmentation—higher trade barriers, sanctions,
and the like—is elevated. Lower international
trade would push down global output and desired
investment. The effect on the natural rate would
vary across regions, reflecting the shortening of
global value chains. The risk of trade fragmentation
is compounded by the risk of financial fragmentation (April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report),
whose effect on real interest rates will depend on
countries’ initial external position: Deficit countries will find it more difficult to finance their
current accounts, while surplus countries will
repatriate excess savings, bringing down the natural
20The model does not capture the endogenous response of capital
flows to a change in preferences for government bonds by foreign
investors. However, this effect could be sizable for safe asset providers
such as the United States. To get a sense of the possible magnitude
of the effect, it is useful to look at gross foreign portfolio investments
in the United States, which increased by about 79 percent of GDP
(US Bureau of Economic Analysis) from their average level before
2000. Were these flows to reverse, simulations show that this could
result in an increase in the natural rate of roughly 100 basis points in
the United States by 2050.

CHAPTER 2

The Natural Rate of Interest: Drivers and Implications for Policy

interest rate. Effects are between a 40 basis point
decline and a 20 basis point increase, depending on
the region. For trade fragmentation, the effects are
expected to be smaller (Box 2.2).

Policy Implications
Overall, the simulations previously discussed indicate that natural rates will likely remain at low levels
in advanced economies, while in emerging market
economies, they are expected to converge from above
toward advanced economies’ levels. These patterns will
have important implications for both monetary and
fiscal policy.

Monetary Policy
Once inflation is brought back to target over the
coming years, which may require a protracted period of
high interest rates (Chapter 1), the implication for monetary policy seems clear: Long-term forces suggest that
natural rates will remain low (in advanced economies) or
decline further (in emerging markets), which may limit
the ability of central banks to ease policy by lowering
nominal interest rates. As a result, monetary institutions
may have to resort to the same strategies they employed
in the decade before the pandemic, such as balance sheet
policy and forward guidance. In addition, if deflationary dynamics take hold, many economies may become
trapped for an extended period in a suboptimal equilibrium characterized by low growth and underemployment (Summers 2014). To address these challenges, a
larger stabilization role may have to be assigned to fiscal
policy, and coordination between fiscal and monetary
policy might even be necessary. Reopening the debate
about the appropriate level of inflation targets, weighing the cost of permanently higher inflation against the
benefit of enhanced monetary policy space, may also
be warranted (Blanchard 2023; Galí 2020; IMF 2010;
Chapter 2 of the April 2020 WEO).

Fiscal Policy
Concerns about debt sustainability have recently
resurfaced due to the sharp increase in government debt
following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the simultaneous rise in policy rates to combat high
inflation. In this context, the key factor for debt sustainability analysis is the difference between the real rate of

interest (r) and the growth rate of the economy ( g). If
growth is higher than the real interest rate, governments
may be able to sustain higher primary budget deficits
without necessarily compromising debt sustainability.
The PP model used earlier in the chapter considered the impact of the fiscal policy stance on the
natural rate, given that public debt issuance increases
demand for loanable funds. This section studies the
implications of secular movements in the natural rate
for debt sustainability. The analysis relies on a partial
equilibrium framework based on recent work by Mian,
Straub, and Sufi (2022).21 This framework takes the
natural interest rate and growth projections from the
PP model as given and assesses debt dynamics under
different scenarios for the eight advanced and emerging
market economies presented in the preceding section.
The framework assumes that savers prefer to hold
government debt due to its liquidity and safety
­features or due to regulatory requirements. This
means ­government debt enjoys a premium in financial
markets relative to comparable assets, known in the
literature as the “convenience yield,” which effectively
translates into a discount extended to the government on its borrowing costs (Krishnamurthy and
Vissing-Jorgensen 2012; Wiriadinata and Presbitero
2020). However, as the public sector accumulates more
debt, government securities become less attractive to
savers, and the borrowing costs for the government
increases: The convenience yield gets eroded. Because
the interest rate increases with the debt level in this
framework, there is a limit to the size of the primary
deficit governments can sustainably run in the long
term.22 The sensitivity of interest rates to debt is
important in this context, and its implications are
discussed at the end of this section.
21Online Annex 2.4 describes the framework in detail. Further
references can be found in Chapter 2 of the April 2022 WEO and
Caselli and others (2022). A framework in which both channels are
mutually operable would be ideal, but it would add a significant
layer of complexity to an already very detailed framework.
22Of course, stabilizing the debt ratio is only one criterion for
debt sustainability. Furman and Summers (2020) and Blanchard
(2023) discuss stabilizing the debt service ratio, or debt service
costs as a percent of GDP, as an alternative. Chapter 2 of the
October 2021 Fiscal Monitor discusses the merit and limitations
of this approach. In a long-term steady state in which borrowing
costs are pinned down by the natural rate of interest, stabilizing the
debt-to-GDP ratio would also stabilize the debt service ratio. The
two measures would, however, diverge over the business cycle, especially if interest rates and growth rates move in opposite directions,
as is often the case in emerging markets.

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

The projections from the PP model and the
elasticity of the convenience yield to the level of the
debt-to-GDP ratio are used to identify the long-term
debt-stabilizing primary balance for each level of debt.
Given current primary balances, the amount of fiscal
consolidation needed is computed under the baseline
and two of the scenarios presented earlier (high debt
and 1970s labor share). Table 2.1 shows the amount of
fiscal consolidation needed for the United States and
China, the single largest representative of each country
group in our sample.23
For the United States, consolidation of about
3.7 percentage points of GDP is needed under the
baseline. In the higher-debt scenario, more consolidation is required, at about 3.9 percentage points of
GDP. Under the higher-labor-share scenario, the difference between the natural rate and long-term growth
becomes less favorable, so that slightly greater consolidation is required relative to the baseline. For China,
the needed consolidation is much greater. A deficit
reduction of about 7.6 percent of GDP is required to
stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term.
The large consolidation reflects China’s sizable primary
deficit of about 7.5 percent of GDP in 2022. In all
scenarios, it is assumed that fiscal adjustment can be
undertaken either in the near term or over the medium
term; the smaller the primary deficit in 2022, the
smaller the fiscal cost of waiting.24
Inference about the fiscal space available to governments is of course uncertain. One important dimension of uncertainty relates to the sensitivity of interest
rates to debt. An increase in the sensitivity of interest
rates to debt essentially lowers the debt threshold at
which primary surpluses are required for sustainability
and thus erodes the fiscal space available to governments. Online Annex 2.4 conducts robustness analysis
around this parameter that highlights the importance
of building safety margins to account for changing
market conditions and investors’ risk perceptions
(Caselli and others 2022).
23This exercise is repeated for the other six large advanced and
emerging market economies in Online Annex 2.4.
24As noted earlier, this is a partial equilibrium exercise. Fiscal consolidation is bound to be more difficult if the effect of deficit reduction on real GDP is taken into account. Also, for China, the chapter
uses the definition of public debt in the World Economic Outlook
database, which uses a narrower perimeter of the general government
than IMF staff estimates in China Article IV reports. See the 2022
Article IV report on China for a reconciliation of the two estimates
and a debt sustainability assessment based on the broader perimeter
of the general government.

interest and growth.

Conclusion
Following four decades of steady decline, real interest
rates appear to have increased in many countries in the
wake of the pandemic. While this uptick clearly reflects
recent monetary policy tightening, this chapter’s analysis
seeks to understand whether the long-term anchor—the
natural rate—has also shifted. This is of key importance
for the pricing of all assets (housing, bonds, equities)
and for monetary and fiscal policy. All else equal, higher
natural rates typically decrease fiscal space—that is,
higher primary surpluses (smaller deficits) are required
to stabilize debt ratios. But they also free up some monetary policy space. Higher natural rates imply higher
nominal rates over the long term, providing central
banks with more space to react to negative demand
shocks without hitting the effective lower bound.
The chapter suggests that recent increases in real
interest rates are likely to be temporary. When inflation
is brought back under control, advanced economies’
central banks are likely to ease monetary policy and
bring real interest rates back toward pre-pandemic levels. How close to those levels will depend on whether
alternative scenarios involving persistently higher
government debt and deficit or financial fragmentation
materialize. In large emerging markets, conservative
projections of future demographic and productivity
trends suggest a gradual convergence toward advanced
economies’ real interest rates.25
25Of course, structural policies that boost potential growth and
diminish inequalities, for example, will tend to lean against these
secular trends.

CHAPTER 2

The Natural Rate of Interest: Drivers and Implications for Policy

This means that the issues associated with the
“effective lower bound” constraint on interest rates
and “low (interest rates) for long” are likely to
resurface.26 Unconventional policies through active
management of central bank balance sheets and
forward guidance may become standard stabilization
tools, even in emerging markets. Debates about the
appropriate level of inflation target may also reemerge

Adrian (2020).

as countries weigh the social cost of higher inflation
against the constraint of ineffective stabilization due
to the effective lower bound. In addition, permanently lower real interest rates also increase fiscal
space—all else equal—and allow fiscal authorities to
take a more active role in stabilizing the economy,
provided fiscal sustainability is ensured (Chapter 2
of the April 2020 WEO). In this case, it is crucial
to clarify the scope and responsibilities of fiscal and
monetary authorities to avoid long-term damage to
the credibility of central banks.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

Box 2.1. The Natural Rate of Interest and the Green Transition
Policy responses to a transition to a carbon-neutral
world will induce significant structural transformation
that will affect the natural rate (r *) via a number of
channels. This box highlights the crucial role of two
channels: the design of climate policies and the level of
international participation in their implementation.
A comprehensive and global policy package
intended to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 serves
as a benchmark, as simulated in Chapter 3 of the
October 2020 World Economic Outlook.1 Carbon
taxes—aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by
2050—are imposed globally, starting at between $6
and $20 a metric ton of CO2 (depending on the
country) and reaching $40 a ton in 2030 and between
$40 and $150 a ton in 2050. The package is fully
financed by the carbon tax revenues—25 percent
recycled toward social transfers, up to 70 percent for
green public infrastructure investment, and the rest
as subsidies to renewable energy sectors—making the
policy budget-neutral.2 Maintaining budget neutrality
helps isolate the impact of the green transition on r *
absent debt-financed green investments. Although they
are subject to uncertainty and intended to be largely
illustrative, the results from simulating the policy
package yield several insights into how climate policies
can be expected to affect r *.
Different climate mitigation policies affect r* differently. Acting alone, carbon taxes depress overall
investment and hence r * (Figure 2.1.1, panel 1). This
is because the carbon tax increases the overall cost
of energy, a complement in production to physical
capital. As a result of frictions, the associated decline
in carbon-intensive activities exceeds the investment
in renewable sources of energy and low-emission
production methods—especially in countries where

Christoph Ungerer.
1Simulations are computed with the G-Cubed model, an
open-economy, multicountry macroclimate model (see Liu and
others 2020; McKibbin and Wilcoxen 1999).
2The scenario differs from the investigation in Chapter 3 of
the October 2020 World Economic Outlook in two ways. First, it
assumes a budget-neutral design rather than deficit financing. Second, given the large uncertainty surrounding the impact of green
public investment on output, the simulations take a conservative
approach and do not assume any direct productivity gains from
green public investment. Of course, any amount of progress in
total factor productivity would tend to lift the natural rate.

The deﬁcit-ﬁnanced package is based on Chapter 3 of the
October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO) but is agnostic
on total factor productivity effects: front-loaded and deﬁcitﬁnanced green public investment of 1 percent of GDP in the
ﬁrst 10 years, 80 percent green subsidies to renewable
sectors, carbon tax revenues recycled to households (1/4),
and public debt reduction (3/4).

Budget-neutral package uses carbon tax revenues to
ﬁnance green public investment, green subsidies, and
household transfers in the same proportion as in Chapter 3
of the October 2020 WEO, but with a much smaller revenue
envelope.

Box 2.1 (continued)
production is carbon intensive. In contrast, public
investment in green infrastructure and subsidies
to renewable energy positively affect investment,
pushing up r *. It is also worth noting that climate
mitigation helps avoid climate-change-related damages, boosting productivity growth with respect to a
business-as-usual baseline and raising r *.
The net impact on r* depends on the associated
overall fiscal impulse. Panel 2 of Figure 2.1.1 shows an
alternative policy package that includes a temporary
deficit-financed and front-loaded green investment
push. Unlike the budget-neutral policy package, which
depresses r * along the entire transition path, this simulation suggests that a deficit-financed fiscal stimulus—
because it increases demand for private savings—could
have a positive impact on r *.

The macroeconomic impact of the green transition
depends on the number of participating countries. In
Figure 2.1.1, panel 3, the climate policy package
is simulated under three different configurations,
depending on whether all countries, only the five
biggest emitters (China, European Union, India,
Japan, United States), or only advanced economies
participate. Not surprisingly, partial participation
in the program leads to a significantly more muted
impact on r *.
Overall, the short- to medium-term impact of the
green transition on r * depends on the balance of several effects. But over the long term, r * would converge
to its pre-climate-policy steady state as economies
become greener and climate policy applies to a shrinking share of economic activity.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

Box 2.2. Geoeconomic Fragmentation and the Natural Interest Rate
Geoeconomic fragmentation impacts regional
economies through different channels, in particular,
trade, technology diffusion, cost of external financing,
international factor mobility, risk, and provision of
global public goods (see Aiyar and others 2023). This
box uses the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal (GIMF) Model1 to analyze two scenarios of
trade and financial fragmentation between the “US
bloc” (United States, European Union, other advanced
economies) and the “China bloc” (China, emerging
Southeast Asia, remaining countries group).2
To understand the impact of trade fragmentation
on the natural rate, it is necessary to grasp its impact
on saving and investment in the US and China
blocs (both deflated by the consumption price index
for comparison). The imposition of nontariff trade
barriers—which are assumed to increase by 50 percent
over 10 years—affects saving in two main ways. First,
trade restrictions tend to increase import prices for all
goods, whether intermediate, investment, or consumption. Second, higher import prices for crucial production
inputs act as a negative productivity shock and reduce
output. Thus, by increasing the price of consumption
(the price of imported consumption goods increases by
about 5 percent to 25 percent depending on the region)
and reducing output, trade barriers tend to reduce saving
and push up the natural rate. Two opposite forces also
determine how trade restrictions impact investment.
First, higher input prices along the global value chain
lower the profitability of production in all regions,
including the “nonaligned bloc,” and depress the volume
of investment demand (see Figure 2.2.1, panel 2). At the
same time, trade restrictions directly increase the relative
price of investment goods (from their higher import
share compared with consumption goods), increasing the
demand for loanable funds, all else equal.
Overall, higher trade barriers between the US and
China blocs will reduce trade between the two regions.
This reduction is partially offset by larger trade within
blocs and with the nonaligned, but the net effect is a
shortening of the global value chain and less global trade

the GIMF Model.
2See Chapter 4 and Online Annex 4.4 for the modification
to the GIMF Model to introduce explicit value chains and the
calibration for eight regions grouped in three blocs: the US bloc,
the China bloc, and the nonaligned bloc. The GIMF Model is
also calibrated so that intermediate inputs (in value chains) and
capital are complements in production.

(–19 percent) and output (–6 percent). Given the structure of trade, real investment in the China bloc declines
the most due to reshoring (Figure 2.2.1, panel 1).
The impact on real interest rates is modest and varies across regions (Figure 2.2.1, panel 2). Real interest
rates are expected to fall by about 30 basis points in
the China bloc as investment demand declines more
than saving does. In the United States, the positive
impact of lower saving on the natural rate and the
negative impact as a result of the decline in investment
broadly balance each other out. In the nonaligned
bloc, trade diversion implies that investment demand
declines by less than desired saving, which raises the
real interest rate by about 10 basis points.

Geoeconomic fragmentation also has implications for
capital markets. In recent decades, and especially since
the end of the 1990s, capital market integration has
allowed advanced economies—and in particular the
United States—to benefit from low borrowing costs.
Savings from emerging markets have increasingly
sought the safety and liquidity of US government
bonds. This has helped bring down the natural rate of
interest in the United States while lifting it in surplus
countries in Asia and the Middle East (Bernanke
2005; Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008, 2016,
2017a, 2017b, 2021). As this process reverses, the
natural rate is likely to increase in the United States
and other advanced economies while decreasing in
emerging markets. In the extreme example of a full
shutdown of capital markets, regional natural rates
would converge to levels that reflect only domestic
drivers such as demographics and productivity.
Figure 2.2.2 presents the macroeconomic impact of a
financial fragmentation scenario assuming the China bloc
reduces its exposure to the US bloc’s Treasury bonds; it
is modeled by reducing the premium paid by foreigners
on US Treasury bonds. The China bloc disposes of net
foreign assets, which pushes down their domestic interest
rate by 40 basis points. In the US bloc, the interest rate
increases by 20 basis points and the net foreign asset
position improves by 10 percent of GDP. The nonaligned
countries experience slight net capital inflows from the
China bloc, as investors look for returns, reducing their
interest rates by about 10 basis points.

Box 2.3. Spillovers to Emerging Market and Developing Economies
Do movements in the natural rate of interest in
advanced economies impact real interest rates in
emerging market and developing economies? And if
so, at what horizon? How strong are such associations,
and what determines their strength?
Many emerging market economies have adopted
inflation targeting—orienting monetary policy
toward domestic stabilization goals. Yet policymakers
in those countries may be unable or unwilling to
closely track global natural rates in the short term.
Thus, for emerging market and developing economies, real rates’ short-term dynamics may appear
disconnected from global forces (Figure 2.2 and
Obstfeld 2021). Arslanalp, Lee, and Rawat (2018)
examine real interest rates in the Asia and Pacific
region and find that a country’s capital market openness is a key factor for linking domestic and global
long-term real rates.
This box’s analysis focuses instead on short-term
real rates that pertain directly to the monetary
policy stance and are less likely to be swayed
by fluctuations in risk or term premiums.1 The
importance of global natural rates to individual
countries’ real interest rate dynamics is measured by
the contribution of the US natural rate to emerging
market economies’ individual forecast error variance
decomposition.
The authors of this box are Christoffer Koch and
Diaa Noureldin.
1This box uses quarterly short-term deposit rates adjusted for
ex post realized inflation. The data are from the first quarter of
2020 to the fourth quarter of 2022, although coverage is uneven,
particularly toward the end of the sample. The primary data
source is the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database.
For countries with short-period gaps, the data are supplemented
with data from Haver Analytics. The emerging market and
developing economies sample consists of Algeria, Bangladesh,
Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chile, China, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Jordan,
Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, Thailand,
Türkiye, and Uganda. To avoid spurious regression, the deciding
selection factor is whether each emerging market and developing
economy rate series is cointegrated with the US rate series. The
Phillips-Perron test is used for stationarity of the residual of the
regression of emerging market and developing economy interest
rates on the US natural rate, allowing for up to four lags. Forecast error variance decomposition is computed based on bivariate
vector autoregression models including the US natural rate and
individual countries’ real interest rates.

Note: Forecast error variance decomposition contributions
for each horizon are weighted by GDP weights adjusted for
purchasing power. EMDEs = emerging market and
developing economies.

Figure 2.3.1 shows that at business cycle horizons
of less than five years, domestic real rates dominate.
At horizons beyond a decade, spillover from the
US natural rate matter just as much. This weighted
aggregation masks substantial variation across countries at longer horizons. The contribution from the
US natural rates tends to be larger for East Asian and
Latin American countries. In large emerging market
economies, such as China and India, about 30 percent of real rate variation is explained by US natural
rates after a decade. After two decades, spillovers are
somewhat stronger in China than in India. Spillover effects to African countries, such as Cameroon,
Côte d’Ivoire, and Uganda, are minor, with less
than a 10 percent contribution from US natural rate
spillovers.
What is the role of capital account openness in
explaining this substantial variation across countries?
To gauge its importance, de facto capital openness—
the sum of foreign assets and liabilities as a percent
of GDP (IIPGDP)—is regressed on the cross-country
variation in magnitude of US natural rate spillovers

CHAPTER 2

Box 2.3 (continued)
to emerging market and developing economies at
80 quarterly horizons. Figure 2.3.2 shows that the
effect of capital account openness becomes significant
only gradually after about a decade. Quantitatively,
a 1 percentage point increase in the gross international investment position as a share of a country’s
GDP raises the importance of the US natural rate
in explaining the share of movements in emerging
market and developing economies’ real interest
rates by half a percentage point after a decade and
by 0.9 percentage point after two. So for a country
like Brazil, with an IIPGDP of about 40 percent,
20 percent of the forecast error variance decomposition of Brazilian real interest rates is attributable to
US spillovers after a decade, and about 36 percent
after two decades. This implies sizable spillovers but
at fairly low frequency.

COMING DOWN TO EARTH: HOW TO TACKLE SOARING PUBLIC DEBT

Public debt as a ratio to GDP soared across the
world during COVID-19 and is expected to remain
elevated, posing a growing challenge for policymakers,
particularly as real interest rates are rising across the
world. This chapter examines the effectiveness of different
approaches to reducing debt-to-GDP ratios. Based on
econometric analyses and complemented with a review
of historical experiences, the chapter reaches three main
conclusions. First, adequately timed (for example,
during economic expansions) and appropriately designed
(for example, more expenditure- than revenue-based
in advanced economies) fiscal consolidations have a
high probability of durably reducing debt ratios. The
debt-reducing effects of fiscal adjustments are reinforced
when accompanied by growth-enhancing structural
reforms and strong institutional frameworks. At the
same time, because these conditions and accompanying
policies may not always be present, and partly because
fiscal consolidation tends to slow GDP growth,
consolidations on average have negligible effects on
debt ratios. Factors such as transfers to state-owned
enterprises, contingent liabilities, or exchange rate
fluctuations can also offset debt reduction efforts. Second,
when a country is in debt distress, a comprehensive
approach that combines significant debt restructuring—
renegotiation of terms of servicing of existing debt—
fiscal consolidation, and policies to support economic
growth can have a significant and long-lasting impact
on reducing debt ratios. Coordination among creditors
is essential. Finally, economic growth and inflation
have historically contributed to reducing debt ratios.

Introduction
Public debt as a ratio to GDP (“debt ratios”
henceforth) has soared across the world during
COVID-19. In 2020, the global average of this

ratio approached 100 percent, and it is expected to
remain above pre-pandemic levels for about half of
the world (Figure 3.1). High public debt ratios are a
significant concern for policymakers, particularly in
light of tightening global financial conditions, weak
economic growth prospects, and a stronger US dollar.
The recent rise in sovereign debt holdings of domestic
financial institutions, particularly in emerging markets,
has further exacerbated the costs of high public debt,
including by limiting the resources available for domestic institutions to lend to the private sector and by
aggravating the risk of adverse sovereign-bank feedback
loops (Chapter 2 of the April 2022 Global Financial
Stability Report).
This chapter examines policy options for reducing
debt ratios, including the effects of fiscal consolidation
(increases in primary balances), growth, and inflation.
While fiscal consolidation can serve several objectives,
the chapter focuses on its impact on debt ratios. The
chapter also draws on historical events of debt restructuring, which is typically a last-resort option, and analyzes the factors that made them effective in reducing
debt. At the outset, it is important to keep in mind
that debt restructuring is often not a policy choice by
countries. It involves a complex process of negotiations
between debtors and creditors, and it can entail significant economic costs, coordination challenges, and
reputational risks.
A vast literature studies the effects of fiscal consolidation on GDP, but far less work has been done on
understanding the impact of fiscal policies on debt
ratios, particularly in emerging market economies and
low-income countries.1 Since fiscal consolidation can
be expected to reduce both debt and GDP, the net
effect of fiscal policies on debt ratios is far from obvious. The empirical literature on the effects of restructuring on debt ratios is relatively limited, and the
1See, for example, Chapter 3 of the October 2010 World Economic
Outlook, Jordà and Taylor (2016), and Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi
(2019) for selected studies that examine the effects of fiscal consolidations on public debt in advanced economies. Balasundharam and others
(2023) document that fiscal consolidation achieves its ex ante objectives
(including improving primary balances in a durable manner and reducing debt) with a probability ranging between 21 and 65 percent.

overall effects of debt restructuring and its interaction
with fiscal policies have rarely been explored.2
Against this backdrop, the chapter attempts to
answer the following questions:
•• How have countries reduced public debt ratios in
the past? What was the contribution of different
factors, including growth and inflation?
•• How effective are different policy approaches in
durably reducing public debt ratios over a horizon
of five years and beyond? What are the short- and
medium-term (one to five years) effects of fiscal
consolidation and debt restructuring on debt ratios,
and how do fiscal consolidation and restructuring
interact? Under which conditions are fiscal consolidation and debt restructuring more likely to durably
reduce debt ratios?
•• What does historical experience suggest for countries
dealing with high debt today?
The chapter presents new evidence on these important issues using an up-to-date data set of fiscal aggregates and a comprehensive set of restructuring events
for advanced economies and emerging market economies over the past two decades. Where information

1–5 percent relative to the precrisis trend following external private
debt restructurings.

is available, low-income countries are also included
in the analysis. The chapter also uses updated data
on historical episodes of fiscal consolidation during
1978–2019 that identify fiscal policy actions aimed at
reducing deficits.3
The main findings of the chapter are as follows:
•• First, adequately timed and appropriately designed
fiscal consolidations have a high probability of durably reducing debt ratios. The average size of primary
balance consolidations that reduced debt ratios
in the past is about 0.4 percentage point of GDP,
lowering the average debt ratio by 0.7 percentage
point in the first year and up to 2.1 percentage
points after five years. About half of the observed
decreases in debt ratios are driven by suitably tailored consolidations.
•• The effectiveness of fiscal consolidation in reducing
public debt ratios is influenced by various factors.
The probability of success in reducing debt ratios
improves from the baseline (average) of about
50 percent to more than 75 percent when (1) there
is a domestic or global expansion and global risk
aversion and financial volatility are low, (2) the
scope for “crowding out” effects is high (cases with
initial high public debt and low private credit such
that the benefits of reducing public debt can outweigh its costs), and (3) the consolidation is driven
more by expenditure reductions than by revenue
increases (in advanced economies).
•• At the same time, because such conditions may not
always hold, and partly because fiscal consolidation
tends to slow GDP growth, the average fiscal consolidation has a negligible effect on debt ratios. Unanticipated transfers to state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
and other contingent liabilities that get realized on
government balance sheets, as well as unexpected
exchange rate depreciations, which can increase the
domestic value of foreign-exchange-denominated
debt, can further offset debt reduction efforts.
•• Debt restructuring is typically used as a last resort
when other efforts to reduce debt have failed and
requires careful consideration of risks and potential consequences. However, in emerging market
economies and low-income countries, where most
restructurings occur, restructuring can significantly
reduce debt ratios by an average of 3.4 percentage
3See Carrière-Swallow, David, and Leigh (2021) and Guajardo,

Leigh, and Pescatori (2014) for earlier versions of the data set on
episodes of consolidation.

CHAPTER 3

points in the first year and 8 percentage points
after five years.
•• Restructurings have historically had larger effects on
debt ratios, especially in the short term, when they
were (1) executed through face value reduction and
(2) part of coordinated and large-scale initiatives for
debt reductions (for example, the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries [HIPC] Initiative and Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative [MDRI]).4
•• Case studies highlight that, in practice, debt restructuring is always a very complex process that involves
burden sharing among residents, domestic creditors,
and foreign creditors. Restructuring can also have
reputational costs, affect interest rates and future
market access, and have internal distributional
consequences. Therefore, debt restructurings are
typically used as part of a broader policy package—
often as a last resort after other efforts have failed
and there is some urgency to reduce debt (or to
provide clear signals that a reduction will come). It
is by no means a free lunch for countries undergoing this process.
•• Economic growth and inflation play an important
role in reducing debt ratios. Growth reduces debt
ratios not only through its effects on nominal GDP,
but also because countries on average consolidate
(run higher primary balances) during good times.
•• In terms of policy lessons, countries aiming for
a moderate and gradual reduction in debt ratios
should implement well-designed fiscal consolidations, particularly when economies are growing
faster and when external conditions are favorable. The debt reduction effects of fiscal adjustments are often reinforced when accompanied by
growth-enhancing structural reforms and strong
institutional frameworks.
•• For countries aiming for more substantial or more
rapid debt reduction, bold policy actions that do not
preclude debt restructuring may be necessary. Fiscal
consolidation may still be necessary to regain market
confidence and recover macroeconomic stability.
Regardless of the type of restructuring, lower debt
4The HIPC and MDRI programs were initiated by official

creditors to help reduce the debt of poor countries through a coordinated set of negotiations involving public debt. To participate,
countries must meet certain criteria, commit to poverty reduction
through policy changes, and demonstrate a good track record
over time. Chuku and others (2023) compare debt vulnerabilities
in low-income countries today versus on the eve of the HIPC
Initiative and examine challenges to a similarly designed debt
relief framework.

Coming Down to Earth: How to Tackle Soaring Public Debt

ratios are achieved when restructuring is deep enough
and is implemented together with comprehensive
policy packages including IMF-supported programs.
•• To ensure success of restructuring in reducing debt
ratios, mechanisms promoting coordination and
confidence among creditors and debtors are necessary. Improving the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework with greater predictability, earlier
engagement, a payment standstill, and further clarification on comparability of treatment can help.5
Most importantly, prioritizing debt management
and transparency in advance can reduce the need for
restructuring and help manage debt distress, which
would be in the interest both of debtor countries
and of their creditors.
•• Although high inflation can reduce debt ratios, the
chapter’s findings do not suggest that it is a desirable policy tool. High inflation can lead to losses
on the balance sheets of sovereign debt holders such
as banks and other financial institutions and, more
crucially, damage the credibility of institutions such
as central banks.
•• Ultimately, reducing debt ratios in a durable manner
depends on strong institutional frameworks, which
prevent “below the line” operations that undermine
debt reduction efforts and ensure that countries
indeed build buffers and reduce debt during good
times.6 In the end, countries’ choices will depend
on a complex set of factors, including domestic and
external conditions, as well as on the fact that not
all alternatives may always be available.
The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows.
The first section documents stylized facts on debt
reduction episodes and then evaluates the roles of
fiscal consolidation, growth, and inflation. The second
section looks into debt restructuring and analyzes its
effectiveness in reducing debt ratios. The third section
exploits the unique vantage point of the IMF and considers case studies of countries that succeeded (or did
not succeed) in reducing debt. The chapter concludes
by drawing lessons for countries aiming to reduce debt
ratios in the current environment.

Macroeconomic Drivers of the
Debt-to-GDP Ratio
This section uses a standard debt decomposition
technique to quantify the contributions of real GDP
growth, nominal interest expenses, the primary balance, and inflation to debt reduction episodes.

Primary Surplus, Growth, and Inflation Are Important
Drivers of Debt Reductions
On average, a debt ratio reduction episode lasts five
years.7 The magnitude of the decline in the debt ratio
is, on average, 3, 5, and 10 percentage points a year in
7The reduction episodes are identified in two steps. The first step
involves identifying turning points in the time series for each country based on the business cycle dating methodology of Harding and
Pagan (2002). A minimum of two years between successive peaks
and troughs and a minimum length of four years for a complete
cycle are imposed. This step decomposes the entire time series into
nonoverlapping periods of surges and reductions. Second, stable
periods with minimum length of three years are identified within
these episodes if the cumulative change in the debt-to-GDP ratio is
either less than 5 percentage points in levels or less than 10 percentage points of the country-specific standard deviation.

advanced economies, emerging market economies, and
low-income countries, respectively (black squares in
Figure 3.2).
The main insights from the decompositions are
threefold (Figure 3.2). First, primary balance surpluses
(red bars) followed by real GDP growth (dark blue
bars) are the most important drivers of debt ratio
reductions in advanced economies. Second, nominal
interest expense (dark yellow bars) always contributes
positively to the change in debt ratios. Third, real
GDP growth and, notably, inflation (dark and light
blue bars, respectively) play a relatively bigger role in
reducing debt ratios in emerging market economies
and low-income countries.8
In theory, high inflation can influence debt ratios
through at least two channels: (1) higher nominal
GDP and (2) higher nominal interest rates. The
second mechanism, in turn, depends on whether
inflation is anticipated or comes as a surprise. In
principle, higher expected inflation (evaluated at the
point when debt is issued) can translate into higher
nominal interest expenses and can cancel out the
favorable effect of inflation on the debt ratio. Unanticipated inflation jumps, on the other hand, affect
debt ratios only through the channel of higher nominal GDP. The April 2023 Fiscal Monitor establishes
that positive inflation surprises significantly reduce
debt ratios.
The standard debt decomposition, however, cannot
separate inflation into its expected and unexpected
components, both of which are likely at play. A
relevant question to ask is: Could expected inflation,
in practice, also be associated with lower debt ratios,
as suggested by the light blue bars in Figure 3.2? Two
pieces of evidence may be consistent with such a
mechanism. First, on average, nominal effective interest rates (defined as nominal interest expense divided
by the stock of the previous year’s debt) in emerging
market economies and low-income countries remain
low relative to inflation (Table 3.1). This may be
attributed to the preponderance of concessional
borrowing in low-income countries or to financial
repression in emerging market economies. Moreover,
8Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, and Norway are examples of
countries with large primary surpluses. See Box 3.1 on the role
of growth-friendly market reforms and Box 3.2 on the role of
interest rates in the context of fiscal and monetary interactions.
While Figure 3.2 focuses on debt reduction episodes, high inflation
could also lead to higher debt, including through unexpected
devaluations.

CHAPTER 3

inflation surprises, including some hyperinflationary periods, may have occurred frequently in these
samples. Second, the evidence presented in Box 3.2
demonstrates that higher expected inflation and
higher policy and market rates feed rather slowly into
effective interest costs of debt, likely because of high
average maturity of sovereign debt (seven years). A
caveat to note is that the relationship between inflation and debt could be more complex and is extensively discussed in the April 2023 Fiscal Monitor. For
example, high inflation could affect tax revenues and
primary balances, lead to misallocation of resources
and increased uncertainty, and in turn affect debt
ratios through additional channels.
The subsections that follow will dig deeper into the
effects of growth and fiscal consolidation shocks on
debt ratios and also track the evolution of inflation and
its implications for debt.

Role of Fiscal Consolidation, Growth, and Inflation
This subsection seeks to answer three questions.
First, how important is growth in reducing debt ratios,
and how does inflation behave during debt reductions?
Second, what are the characteristics of fiscal consolidations that durably reduce debt ratios? Third, under
what conditions is it more likely that fiscal consolidation translates into lower debt ratios? While the chapter focuses on the ex post effects of fiscal consolidation
on public debt ratios, fiscal adjustments may not be
intended to reduce debt and could happen for different
reasons, for example, in response to shocks such as
tightening financing conditions, to offset spending in
public sector entities, or to combat inflation.
The analysis uses annual data on fiscal and macroeconomic aggregates for a sample of 33 emerging
market economies starting in 1990 and 21 advanced
economies starting in 1980. An updated version of
the narrative fiscal consolidations data developed by
Devries and others (2011) and Carrière-Swallow,
David, and Leigh (2021) is also used in the analysis.

The Average Consolidation: Does It Reduce the
Debt-to-GDP Ratio?
A stylized fact is that simultaneous consolidations
and debt ratio reductions are infrequent: Only 52 percent of increases in primary balance are accompanied
by a decrease in debt ratios. This aligns with analysis
by Balasundharam and others (2023) documenting

that only about half of fiscal consolidations achieve
their fiscal targets, including debt reduction.
A broad range of econometric methods, based on
well-established methods in the empirical literature, confirm that fiscal consolidations do not reduce debt ratios,
on average.9 These methods draw from a large literature
to account for biases that arise when both consolidations and debt are driven by other factors, including
the macroeconomic environment. For example, the
aforementioned “narrative shocks” are used to select
cases in which governments implemented tax hikes or
spending cuts with the explicit intention of reducing
the public deficit and putting public finances on a more
sustainable footing, irrespective of current and prospective macroeconomic conditions. Results suggest that, on
average, consolidations do not lead to a statistically significant effect on the debt ratio. An alternative approach
employs an augmented inverse-probability-weighted
(AIPW) estimator (Jordà and Taylor 2016) to account
for the fact that consolidations do not happen randomly.
This estimator first predicts the probability of experiencing a narrative shock, using indicators such as GDP
growth and debt levels. It then estimates the impact of
narrative shocks on the debt ratio using local-projection
methods, while reweighting observations using the
predicted probabilities. As shown in Figure 3.3, those
adjustments do not change the finding that the average
narrative fiscal consolidation does not have a statistically
significant impact on the debt ratio.

What Conditions Improve the Chances of Consolidation
Reducing the Debt-to-GDP Ratio?
Next, the analysis turns to the relevant question:
Under which conditions are fiscal consolidations
more likely to reduce debt ratios? A structural

vector autoregression (SVAR) model that considers jointly the well-known drivers of debt ratios,
namely, real GDP growth, interest rates, inflation,
government revenues, and primary balance, is
applied to answer this question. The model uses a
sign-restriction-based identification, following the
method of Mountford and Uhlig (2009). Consistent with the previous analysis, the SVAR approach
also suggests that consolidations do not reduce
debt ratios, on average (Online Annex 3.3).10 The
result is robust to estimation through narrative sign
restrictions based on the narrative data discussed
earlier (as in Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez
2018). The flexibility of the SVAR can be used to
study the features of consolidations that reduce debt
ratios. To do so, the primary balance shock (defined
as a change in the primary-balance-to-GDP ratio
outside of a business cycle) is split into two different (orthogonal) components: a successful shock,
after which the debt ratio declines, and one that
is unsuccessful, after which the debt ratio rises in

response to a positive shock or an improvement in
the primary-balance-to-GDP ratio (Table 3.2). Note
that the method puts restrictions on the sign of the
comovement between the variables and does not
impose any other constraint, say, on the magnitude
of the responses.
The historical decomposition from the SVAR
is used to derive the contributions of growth and
changes in the primary balance to changes in the
debt ratio and highlights two important patterns
(Table 3.3). First, higher GDP growth (as captured
by positive demand and supply shocks together) is
an important force driving debt ratios and explains
about one-third of the observed reductions. This is
because of the effect on nominal GDP, but importantly also because countries, on average, run primary
deficits in bad times and primary surpluses during
good times. Indeed, market reforms, complemented
with improvements in fiscal frameworks, can increase
growth and reduce debt ratios durably and significantly (Box 3.1).11
Second, about 40 percent of the observed debt ratio
reductions in both advanced and emerging market
economies are explained by primary balance shocks,
with a relatively even split between successful and
unsuccessful primary balance shocks (Table 3.3). Note
that unsuccessful primary balance shocks—identified
by a positive comovement of primary balance and debt
ratio on impact—can also lead to debt reductions.
These shocks encompass improvements in the primary
balance that result in increasing debt ratios, but they
also include symmetric cases in which a worsening of
11The contributions of each shock to the unexpected reductions in
the debt-to-GDP ratio are based on a country-by-country historical
decomposition from the SVAR. This is akin to a structural debt
decomposition.

the primary balance (for example, fiscal expansion)
results in debt reductions, partly owing to positive
GDP effects.
The question to be considered now is under which
conditions primary balance consolidations turn into
debt ratio reductions and what the characteristics of
such consolidations are.

Characteristics of Consolidations That Drive the
Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Two characteristics distinguish consolidations that
lead to a reduction in debt ratios (successful) versus
those that do not (unsuccessful) (Figure 3.4). First,
the decline in growth is smaller (0.5 percent reduction on impact) in consolidations that reduce debt
ratios compared with those that do not (1.3 percent
reduction). As expected, successful consolidations
reduce debt ratios because the negative effects on
output are mitigated. At the same time, it is impor­
tant to note that movements in GDP alone are not
the most important factor determining the difference
between successful and unsuccessful consolidations.
This point is evident in a comparison of the response
of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio (Figure 3.4,
panels 1 and 4). In successful cases (blue lines),
GDP falls, and the debt-to-GDP ratio also falls; in
unsuccessful cases (red lines), GDP falls, but the
debt-to-GDP ratio increases twice as much as the fall
in GDP. That is, the difference between successful
and unsuccessful consolidations is driven primarily by
movements in debt.
Second, the response of inflation to the consolidation shock is positive (Figure 3.4, panel 6). Several
factors could contribute to this positive impact on
inflation. For instance, the typical consolidation entails
a revenue (tax increase) component that could push
prices up. Moreover, any exchange rate depreciation
concomitant with the consolidation could also increase

import prices and contribute to inflation.12 The differential response of effective interest rates on impact
in successful versus unsuccessful consolidations
(Figure 3.4, panel 5) suggests that monetary policy
remains more accommodative on impact and hence
allows higher inflation in the case of successful consolidations. For successful consolidations, however, the
impact on nominal effective interest rates is statistically
indistinguishable from zero. Thus, the inflation hike
contributes mainly to an increase in nominal GDP and
results in a decline in the debt ratio. Debt decomposition identities (reported in Online Annex 3.2) suggest
that inflation contributes significantly—about half a
percentage point—to the reduction in the debt ratio
for successful fiscal consolidations.
Furthermore, in advanced economies, successful
consolidations tend to be balanced between spending
cuts and tax or revenue increases, whereas those that
are unsuccessful are biased toward revenue and involve
fewer spending cuts (Online Annex 3.3). This pattern
is not found in emerging market economies, consistent
with studies that find tax increases hurt growth and debt
ratios more than equivalent spending cuts in advanced
economies but not necessarily in emerging market economies (see, for instance, Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori
2014; Carrière-Swallow, David, and Leigh 2021;
and Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi 2019). Indeed, for
low-income countries, where the tax-revenue-to-GDP
ratio is particularly low, revenue-mobilizing consolidations may be more desirable (October 2022 Regional
Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa).13
Successful consolidations, in fact, durably reduce
debt ratios, even beyond a five-year horizon, as illustrated in Online Annex 3.3. The average consolidation
shock in the data implies a sustained improvement
12Consolidations may boost the economic outlook and investor sentiment, leading to an appreciation of exchange rates, but
evidence for such effects is weak (Beetsma and others 2015). The
exchange rate implications are vital for low-income countries where
foreign-currency-denominated debt forms a significant share of public debt. Exchange rate depreciation has been a major contributor to
the increase in debt ratios in sub-Saharan Africa (April 2023 Regional
Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa). In addition, Chapter 3 of
the October 2010 World Economic Outlook finds that policy interest
rate cuts can support output during fiscal consolidations, which
would also be consistent with a positive inflation response, but the
analysis in this chapter does not identify a substantial response of
effective interest rates to fiscal consolidations.

of fiscal consolidation in low-income countries and compare the

in the primary balance, mostly on impact, of
0.4 percentage point of GDP. It reduces debt ratios
persistently, starting with 0.7 percentage point by
the first year and stabilizing at a 2.1 percentage point
reduction by year five and beyond.
Fiscal consolidation may also fail to reduce debt
ratios if countries conduct below-the-line operations
that can offset the impact of fiscal consolidation on
debt. Examples include transfers to state-owned enterprises in Mexico (2016), clearance of arrears in Greece
(2016), and contingent liabilities in Italy (2013).14
The historical decompositions from the SVAR are
further used to isolate periods of successful consolidations and identify the conditions that improve the
probability that fiscal consolidation will translate into a
lower debt ratio (Figure 3.5). Consolidations are more
likely to reduce debt ratios during good times (for
example, domestic and global booms, as well as periods of less financial tightening and less volatility and
uncertainty captured by the Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index [VIX]) and when the initial public-debt-to-GDP ratio is high and the initial
private-credit-to-GDP ratio is low. Note that, in theory,
the direction of the effect of initial debt levels on the
likelihood of successful consolidations could go either
way. When initial debt is high, the direct effect of fiscal
consolidation (or the numerator) on the value of debt is
small; at the same time, consolidations hurt output (or
the denominator) less when initial debt is high, likely
because of greater crowding out of investment (Ilzetzki,
Mendoza, and Vegh 2013; Kirchner, Cimadomo, and
Hauptmeier 2010). The results reported in Figure 3.5
suggest that the latter effect dominates. (See Online
Annex 3.3 for a mathematical illustration of these
points.) The magnitudes of the estimates suggest that
consolidations undertaken during domestic and global
booms and when financial volatility is low can increase
the probability of durably reducing debt ratios from the
baseline of close to 50 percent to about 75 percent and
even more if, in addition, crowding-out effects are high.15

14See IMF (2016), IMF (2017) and IMF (2013), respectively. The
phenomenon is not limited to advanced and emerging market economies. The contribution of such below-the-line operations to rising
debt ratios has been persistently high in recent times in sub-Saharan
Africa (April 2023 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa).
15The numbers are computed by adding the coefficients from a
multivariate standardized logit regression plotted in Figure 3.5. For
instance, when global and domestic output gaps are one standard
deviation above mean and the VIX is one standard deviation
below, the probability increases from a baseline of 51 to 75 percent

CHAPTER 3

Debt Restructuring and Its Effects
While fiscal consolidation, growth, and inflation can
help reduce debt ratios, they may not be sufficient for
countries facing disruptive levels of debt. In such cases,
debt restructuring may be necessary. Debt restructuring
is often not a policy choice and is used as a last resort
after other efforts have failed and there is an urgent need
to reduce debt or provide clear signals of a reduction.
It is a complex process involving negotiations between
debtors and creditors and can come with large costs,
reputational risks, and negative impacts on the economy
overall.16 In addition, it can adversely affect creditors,
reduce their ability to provide concessional financing,
and lead to spillovers in global markets. This section first
defines key concepts related to debt restructuring and
documents stylized facts. Next it addresses the question:
How effective have past restructuring events been in
reducing debt and under what conditions?

Definition and Characteristics of Restructuring
Public debt restructuring is broadly defined as a
“debt distress” event in which the terms of contractual
payments of some outstanding government instruments are renegotiated, typically with a net present
value loss for the creditor.17
Restructurings can differ along at least three dimensions. First, the types of creditors can be official or
private. Official creditors include Paris Club countries,
non–Paris Club G20 creditors (for example, China,
India, and South Africa), and other official creditors.18
Private creditors can be external or domestic residents.
Second, the timing of restructuring can be preemptive
(that is, before any payments are missed) or after default.
(~=51+6.1+9.1+9.9), based on the numbers above and below the
blue bars in Figure 3.5.
16Preemptive restructurings can be associated with smaller costs
and relatively muted impact on the overall economy compared with
postdefault restructurings (Asonuma and Trebesch 2016; Asonuma
and others 2021), though historically preemptive restructurings have
also been less deep.
17An external debt restructuring refers to a formal renegotiation process of outstanding debt instruments issued under foreign
jurisdiction and held by external creditors, which may involve a
net present value loss for creditors (Asonuma and Papaioannou,
forthcoming; Das, Papaioannou, and Trebesch 2012). A domestic
sovereign debt restructuring has a similar definition, but the debt
instruments are issued under domestic jurisdiction and held mainly
by domestic creditors. There are also legal considerations unique to
domestic debt restructuring (IMF 2021).
18Note that information on debt restructurings by non–Paris Club
creditors is available only for China.

Note: Figure shows estimates of a multivariate standardized logit regression with
the dependent variable being a dummy equal to 1 for a successful consolidation
(in which debt to GDP declines and the successful shock from the vector
autoregression contributes at least 10 percent to the decline) and equal to 0 for an
unsuccessful consolidation (for example, if debt to GDP increases and the
unsuccessful consolidation shock from the vector autoregression contributes at
least 10 percent to the increase). The baseline of 51 percent on the y-axis

coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level based on bootstrap standard
errors. World output gap variable is orthogonalized with respect to domestic output
gap to recover the exogenous component. Sample consists of 21 advanced
economies from 1981 to 2019 and 37 emerging market economies from 1994 to
2019. VIX = Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index.

Third, the implementation of debt restructuring can take
different forms. For example, restructuring can take place
through a reduction in the face value of debt (which
reduces the debt stock immediately) or through cash
flow relief with no face value reduction (for example, an
extension of maturity or a reduction in coupon payments). Cash flow relief with no face value reduction
reduces the present value of debt through changes in the
schedule of payments.
Following the introduction of key concepts, the next
subsection presents a summary of essential stylized
facts pertaining to debt restructuring.
Drawing from a compilation of databases, 709 restructuring events were reported from 1950 to 2021, across
115 countries. Almost all events were in emerging market
economies and low-income countries. Debt restructurings
often involve cash flow relief with no face value reduction,
tend to happen preemptively (rather than postdefault),

and most frequently involve official creditors, especially
in low-income countries (Table 3.4). Restructurings with
domestic creditors are rare and may reflect intentions
to avoid risks in the domestic financial sector; these
are also less likely to involve face value reduction, and
even when they do, the reduction tends to be shallower
compared with restructurings with external creditors (see,
for example, the cases of Cyprus and Jamaica in “Going
Granular: Case Studies of Debt Restructuring”).19
Fiscal consolidations, measured by an increase
in the primary-balance-to-GDP ratio, are commonly implemented prior to debt restructuring.
Figure 3.6 shows that, in the sample with available
data on primary balances, 60 percent of debt restructuring events are preceded by an increase in the
primary-balance-to-GDP ratio, indicating that countries often undertake fiscal measures before resorting
to debt restructuring.

Debt-to-GDP Ratio Reduction Is Large during
Restructuring
To give a sense of the magnitude of the role restructuring plays in the reduction of debt ratios, Figure 3.7
distinguishes between reduction episodes that involve
19In each country, a year is counted as a restructuring event if restructuring starts in that year. Restructurings could involve multiple creditors,
in which case the count of events is still 1 if they happen in the same
year. A restructuring event can last multiple years. Details on the sources
on the episodes of restructurings are in Online Annex 3.6. See IMF
(2021) for further discussion on restructuring of domestic debt.

restructuring and those that do not. Not surprisingly,
the decline in debt ratios during restructuring events
is larger, 13 percentage points in emerging market
economies and 18 percentage points in low-income
countries, as shown by the black squares in Figure 3.7.
Without restructuring, the average reduction is about
4 percentage points and 8 percentage points, respectively. Inflation plays an even larger role in debt
reduction episodes with restructurings. This may reflect
that restructuring often coincides with economic crises
and is accompanied by capital outflows, exchange rate
depreciations, and higher inflation.

High Chances of Restructuring
An important question to ask in the current environment is: How likely will debt restructuring be in the
future? One way to gauge chances of future restructuring is to look at the past and note that restructurings
have followed surges in debt ratios. In fact, waves of
restructurings followed debt ratio surges in both the
1980s and early 2000s (Figure 3.8). The share of countries with surging debt ratios has also been on the rise
since the global financial crisis. This may suggest that,
if history repeats itself, there could be a good chance of
more restructurings in the near future. So far—possibly
because of low interest rates and ease of financing
conditions—a wave of restructurings has not occurred.

Estimated Effects of Debt Restructuring

The findings suggest that the debt restructuring process
in emerging market economies and low-income countries can have a significant and long-lasting impact on
debt ratios (Figure 3.9, panel 1). On average, debt ratios
decrease by 3.4 percentage points in the first year and
8 percentage points within five years of restructuring, and
this effect is heightened when accompanied by fiscal consolidation. This is in line with the fact that two-thirds of
restructuring events in the sample were accompanied by
fiscal consolidation. In addition, the joint effect of restructuring and fiscal consolidation grows over time, indicating
that the two policies are complementary.
The identity and composition of creditors, the nature
of negotiations, and the context in which restructuring takes place can greatly affect its outcome as well.
Figure 3.9 (panel 2) shows that restructuring under the
HIPC or MDRI programs more successfully reduced
debt ratios than the typical restructuring, both on impact
and over longer horizons.20 The results are as expected,

To estimate the impact of debt restructuring, this
section employs the AIPW estimator, which takes into
account the nonrandom nature of restructuring events.
As discussed earlier, the procedure first estimates the
probability that a country will begin debt restructuring negotiations based on macroeconomic factors and
uses this information to reweight observations in an
outcome model, as detailed in Online Annex 3.5.

20Treatment in this case is identified as a restructuring event
that (1) involved an official creditor (Paris Club or multilateral
institution) and (2) happened in a country that benefited from either
the HIPC Initiative or MDRI. A similar analysis was conducted to
uncover differences between domestic and external restructurings. As
noted also in Table 3.4, there are very few cases of restructuring that
involved domestic creditors only—fewer than 40 across the whole
sample. With this caveat, the results suggest that external restructuring has a larger (negative) effect on the debt ratio.

An exception is those in 2020 and 2021 under the G20
Debt Service Suspension Initiative, designed to mitigate
the economic costs of the pandemic in developing economies. However, the changing global environment (for
example, low growth, tightening financing conditions,
strong dollar) could raise these risks. That said, the process could differ significantly from that in the past, given
the changing composition of creditors, the enhanced use
of collective action clauses in sovereign bonds, and the
G20 Common Framework initiative.

as the HIPC and MDRI programs were (1) characterized
by coordination among creditors, (2) involved deep face
value reductions, and (3) included IMF-supported programs. Figure 3.9 (panel 3) illustrates that restructuring
events with face value reductions have a greater impact
on the debt-to-GDP ratio, with much of the effect visible in the first year.
Three caveats need to be considered when interpreting the results. First, the HIPC Initiative and MDRI
were one-off initiatives. Second, face value reductions
happen more frequently when the initial debt ratio is
high.21 Third, about half of restructuring events with
face value reduction happened under the HIPC Initiative (Table 3.5), although the stronger effect of face
value reductions on debt ratios is robust to excluding
HIPC events from the sample.22
To summarize, debt restructuring in emerging
market economies and low-income countries can have
a large, negative, and long-lasting effect on debt ratios
(see Online Annex 3.5 for similar effects of restructuring beyond five years). This effect is heightened when

21The average debt ratios one year preceding the event with and
without face value reductions are 90 and 75 percent, respectively.
22The results are qualitatively similar to those reported in
Figure 3.9, panel 3, if the treatment includes (1) all non-HIPC
events (24 events); (2) events that did not include entry into the
HIPC program within three years of the start of restructuring,
excluding borderline cases (16 events); or (3) the latter, including
private external creditors (33 + 16 = 49 events). Notably, an alternative definition of HIPC treatment based on eligibility at the time of
the HIPC decision points rather than completion of restructuring
(20 non-HIPC events instead of 24, or 7 non-HIPC if based on
an “ever-eligible” HIPC decision point criteria) gives a qualitatively
similar finding of bigger effects of restructuring events with face
value reductions on debt ratios. Note that information on face value
reductions in MDRI programs is not available; hence, the analysis
includes only non-HIPC treatment.

CHAPTER 3

the restructuring is combined with fiscal consolidation,
and is implemented through large-scale initiatives with
coordination mechanisms across creditors.

Comparing Magnitudes
How does the impact of fiscal consolidation on the
debt ratio compare with that of debt restructuring?
The previous section and Table 3.6 (last two columns:
“ATE”) suggest that average restructuring can have a
much larger effect than fiscal consolidation. But the
two may not be exactly comparable because their “size”
is also very different. The average face value reduction
in the debt ratio is about 4.2 percent of GDP per year
that the restructuring event lasts, while the average
successful fiscal consolidation reduces the primary
balance by only 0.4 percent of GDP (Table 3.6). A
back-of-the-envelope calculation performed by dividing
the estimated average treatment effect by the treatment size reveals that, after one year, the impact of a
successful fiscal consolidation is comparable to that of
debt restructuring with face value reduction, per “unit”
of treatment.23 After five years, fiscal consolidations are
on average more effective according to this metric.
An important caveat from this comparison exercise is
that fiscal consolidations and restructurings can happen
under very different circumstances. Even different types
of restructuring can reflect disparate contexts depending
on the macroeconomic conditions, type of debt to be
restructured, creditor preferences, creditor structure,
and other factors. Ultimate policy choices by countries
could manifest complex combinations of these factors
and importantly also reflect the fact that alternatives
may not be available in practice. However, these issues
are difficult to capture through econometric analysis
because of the presence of unobserved variables that
can affect both policy choices and outcomes. Moreover,
the results of econometric analysis are based on typical
historical events and may not capture the subtleties of
specific cases, which could provide valuable insights for
the future. For example, debt restructurings conducted
preemptively (before a default) in the past have typically
been based on cash flow (but not face value) reductions
and have rarely been deep (Asonuma, Chamon, and
23A 1 percentage point face value reduction can decrease the debt
ratio by, on average, 1.9 percentage points, exceeding the “mechanical” impact on the debt ratio. This is possible when the restructuring
event has a limited (negative) or positive impact on GDP growth
and when it is supported by macro policies. In many cases, higher
inflation and depreciation in exchange rates also contribute.

This value is then averaged across all restructuring events. In successful
consolidations, size refers to the average reduction in primary balance over
GDP after a fiscal consolidation. ATE = average treatment effect; FVR = face
value reduction.

He 2023). This makes it hard to quantify the impact
of “deep enough” preemptive restructuring, as events of
that type have been rare in the past. Therefore, the next
section complements the analysis by reviewing historical
experiences of successful and unsuccessful debt reductions to draw lessons for the future.

Going Granular: Case Studies of Debt
Restructuring
This section draws on historical policy documents,
including IMF staff reports, to derive granular policy
lessons from the experience of countries that experienced a debt restructuring. It considers five specific

(3) Seychelles, 2009–15; (4) Belize, 2012–19; and
(5) Mozambique, 2016–19. The case studies are
divided into those in which the debt restructuring
managed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio and those
in which it did not (Table 3.7).24 A key insight from
the episodes is that public debt restructuring is a
complex process that involves burden sharing among
domestic residents, domestic creditors, and foreign
creditors. In external debt restructurings, the burden
is primarily shared between residents and foreign
creditors (for example, Seychelles), while in domestic debt restructurings, it is mostly shared between
residents and domestic creditors (mainly banks; for

Division of the IMF’s Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.
These are recent experiences of countries that could offer interesting,
but also relatively general, insights. Discussions with the corresponding teams assigned to work on each of the countries also provided
additional insights.

1Cash flow relief with no face value reduction corresponds to maturity extension, reduction in coupon payments, or both.

positive contribution of nominal interest expenses by 40 percentage points and 30 percentage points completely offset the impacts.

example, Cyprus and Jamaica). Restructurings with
external creditors often occur postdefault and may
involve face value reductions (possibly for both official and private creditors as, for example, in the case
of Seychelles), which immediately lower debt ratios.
In restructurings with domestic creditors, financial
stability concerns play a role, and they are typically
implemented through cash flow relief with no face
value reduction. Therefore, reductions in debt ratios
tend to be gradual. Regardless of the type, one key
lesson for the future is that restructuring needs to be
deep to improve its chances of success.

Success in Reducing Public-Debt-to-GDP Ratios
Debt ratios declined substantially in Jamaica and
Seychelles and modestly in Cyprus, as shown by the
black squares in Figure 3.10. In Seychelles, the debt
ratio had reached 180 percent in 2008, concomitant with twin balance of payments and debt crises,
and a sharp exchange rate depreciation. Debt ratios
in Jamaica and Cyprus also reached above 140 and
100 percent, respectively. A sharp exchange rate depreciation combined with low growth during the global
financial crisis played an important role in the increase
in the debt ratio in Jamaica. In turn, a deterioration in
the fiscal stance and financial assistance to the banking
82

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

sector were key factors affecting increases in the debt
ratio in Cyprus.25
In Seychelles, the ratio declined rapidly and sharply
to 84 percent in 2010. This happened immediately
after debt restructurings with both official Paris Club
and private external creditors that involved a large
reduction in face value of debt.26 Prudent fiscal policy
combined with high inflation helped in sustaining
the reduction in debt ratios (Figure 3.10). In Cyprus
and Jamaica, debt ratios did not fall immediately after
domestic debt restructurings (2013 for Cyprus and
2010 and 2013 for Jamaica), which did not involve
face value reductions. Yet in the case of Jamaica, the
cash flow relief from restructuring was deep and was
saved, with the debt-to-GDP ratio declining significantly to 100 percent by 2018. In contrast, the cash
flow relief from restructuring was only modest in
Cyprus, and the debt-to-GDP ratio declined by less,
to about 90 percent by 2019. Fiscal consolidation (red
bars in Figure 3.10) contributed in both cases, as the
debt service relief was partly saved. A recovery in GDP
25The evolution of debt and its correlates over time for each of the
case studies are reported in Online Annex 3.7.
26Interestingly, Seychelles achieved sizable face value reductions
when foreign creditors were experiencing unfavorable business and
financial cycles. See Asonuma and Joo (2020) for the role of foreign
creditors in sovereign debt restructurings.

CHAPTER 3

growth in Cyprus (dark blue bars) and high inflation
in Jamaica (light blue bars) played important roles in
debt reduction, though the positive contribution of
nominal interest expenses almost offset the impact of
inflation in Jamaica.
To summarize, in successful cases, debt restructurings contributed significantly to reducing public debt ratios, either directly (through face value
reduction, for example, by 25 percentage points in
Seychelles) or indirectly (through debt service relief
and fiscal consolidation in Cyprus and Jamaica). The
possibility of success of (deep enough) preemptive
restructuring executed through cash flow relief, rather
than face value reductions, is illustrated by the case
of Jamaica.27
Economic growth also contributed to reducing debt
ratios in all these experiences—by more than 20 percentage points in both Cyprus and Seychelles and by
7 percentage points in Jamaica (Figure 3.10). Finally,
inflation also played an important role, contributing
to the reduction by 50 percentage points in Seychelles
and by 70 percentage points in Jamaica, though the
positive contribution of nominal interest expenses
offset the impact on debt—partly in Seychelles and
completely in Jamaica (Figure 3.10).

Debt Remaining Elevated or Increased
It is also instructive to review experiences of countries that did not succeed in reducing debt, as these
may offer a cautionary tale for countries currently
struggling with high public debt. Public debt in Belize
and Mozambique remained elevated despite two
sequential debt restructurings in both (2012–13 and
2016–17 in Belize, 2015–16 and 2016–19 in Mozambique). Debt ratios remained at above 90 percent in
both countries as of 2019.28

27This is typically not the case based on historical events,
econometric analysis of which finds that restructurings executed
postdefault and with face value reductions to be more effective in
reducing debt ratios.
28Prior to this, Belize had another debt restructuring in 2006–07
that reduced public debt more durably, with public debt in 2011
being 5 percentage points of GDP lower than in 2006. While
the episode is not considered as a case study here, Belize has been
successful at reducing public debt more recently following a surge
from the COVID-19 crisis. Public debt declined to 64 percent of
GDP in 2022 as a result of sizable fiscal consolidation, a debt swap
with The Nature Conservancy for marine protection, a discount on
debt owed to Venezuela under Petrocaribe, and a strong rebound in
economic activity.

While restructuring was executed through cash flow
relief with no face value reduction in both countries,
the resulting debt service relief was, in fact, used to
support expansionary public expenditure. Whereas
Belize did not request an IMF-supported program, the
request from Mozambique was approved in December
2015, but the program was interrupted soon thereafter. Transfers to state-owned enterprises resulted in a
substantial increase in the debt ratio in Mozambique,
by 13.8 percentage points (Figure 3.10).
Overall, the main lesson that emerges from the
review of historical experiences of debt restructurings is that, for a sizable and durable reduction in
debt ratios, restructurings need to be deep enough,
no matter how they are executed, and need to be
combined with a comprehensive set of fiscal and
growth-enhancing reforms.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
This section summarizes the main findings of the
chapter and outlines key lessons for countries currently
facing the challenge of high public debt burdens.
First, adequately timed (for example, during
economic expansions) and appropriately designed
International Monetary Fund | April 2023

83

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Rock y Recovery

(for example, growth friendly—which in advanced
economies includes involving more expenditure- than
revenue-based measures) fiscal consolidations have
a high probability of durably reducing debt ratios.
The average successful fiscal consolidation in the data
(equal to 0.4 percentage point of GDP) reduces debt
ratios by 0.7 percentage point during its first year
and, cumulatively, by up to 2.1 percentage points
after five years. The debt-reducing effects of fiscal
adjustments are reinforced when accompanied by
growth-enhancing structural reforms and strong institutional frameworks. At the same time, because these
conditions and accompanying policies are not always
present, and because fiscal consolidation tends to slow
GDP growth, on average, fiscal consolidations have a
negligible effect on debt ratios.
Second, the impact of restructuring (which
occurs mostly in emerging market economies and
low-income countries) on debt ratios can be sizable
and long-lasting. The average observed restructuring
reduces debt ratios by 3.4 percentage points in the first
year and, cumulatively, 8.0 percentage points after five
years. The impact is more immediate when the restructuring is implemented through a face value reduction
and stronger when combined with fiscal consolidation.
Third, selected case studies of countries that experienced debt restructuring offer both instructive lessons
and cautionary guidance. All cases studied emphasized
the importance of medium-term fiscal consolidation.
Fiscal consolidation played an important role even in
cases that involved significant face value reductions.
It can also help to persuade external creditors to agree
to a reduction in the nominal value of debt. For debt
restructurings that were carried out preemptively with
domestic creditors and involved debt service relief,
fiscal consolidation was vital in gradually reducing
debt ratios.
Finally, both economic growth and inflation play
an important role in reducing debt ratios. The results
from this chapter complement the messages from
related work (April 2023 Fiscal Monitor), including
the importance of inflation and the scope of structural
reforms to promote growth, which ultimately reduces
debt ratios.
Turning to the policy implications, when a moderate and gradual reduction in debt ratios is viable,
well-designed fiscal consolidation, beyond automatic
stabilizers or what would be implemented during
economic cycles, along with growth-friendly structural
reforms, is appropriate. Such fiscal consolidation
84

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

should ideally coincide with domestic recovery, favorable external conditions, or both.
Some countries facing high risks of debt distress or
increased rollover risks may have no viable alternative other than a substantial or rapid debt reduction.
These countries will require sustained and complementary policy actions. Fiscal consolidation will likely
be needed to regain market confidence and recover
macroeconomic stability. In addition, debt restructuring should also be considered in a timely way, and
if pursued, will need to be deep to be successful in
reducing debt ratios. Countries typically do not weigh
fiscal, structural, and debt restructuring equally in
their decisions. Instead, they design a macroeconomic
program (fiscal and growth-enhancing structural
reforms), and if this does not work convincingly, then
restructuring may be considered as a last-resort option.
This chapter suggests that all policies that help reduce
debt may have to be considered from the outset.
Although historical events have not typically included
deep-enough restructurings carried out preemptively,
Jamaica provides an example in which debt ratios were
reduced significantly with early and deep restructurings that were executed through cash flow relief. In
contrast, the case of Belize suggests that even when
treatment is undertaken early, if it is not deep enough,
debt could remain elevated.
Debt restructuring is an altogether different process
from other policies to reduce debt. Restructuring is
always complex, takes time, requires mutual agreement
between creditors and debtors, and involves burden
sharing among various parties. Mechanisms that
promote coordination and confidence among creditors and debtors are required for debt restructurings
to reduce debt ratios. Improving the G20 Common
Framework, with greater predictability on steps in the
process, earlier engagement with official and private
creditors, a debt service payment standstill during
negotiations, and further clarification on comparability of treatment, could help. Nevertheless, countries
must still put a priority on debt management and
transparency to manage risks and reduce the need for
restructuring, which is in the interest of both debtors
and creditors.
Although the chapter documents the significance of
inflation in reducing debt ratios, this does not suggest
that high inflation is a desirable tool. High inflation,
even if it is unanticipated, can become entrenched in
higher expectations of price increases and exchange rate
depreciations, raise the burden of future debt issuance,

CHAPTER 3

generate monetary instability, lead to loss of reputation, and in the end affect the credibility of institutions, including central banks.
Ultimately, strong institutions are crucial to
durable debt reduction. Robust fiscal and monetary
frameworks can prevent operations that undermine
debt reduction efforts and help countries benefit
from global forces pushing down the natural interest

rate (Box 3.2). Developing a credible medium-term
fiscal framework can help countries manage high
debt as they undertake fiscal adjustments to rebuild
buffers (Gaspar, Obstfeld, and Sahay 2016; Caselli
and others 2022). Finally, a medium-term debt
management strategy can provide a structured
approach for governments to evaluate costs and risks
associated with financing options.

Box 3.1. Market Reforms to Promote Growth and Debt Sustainability
Market reforms in emerging market and developing
economies may offer a valuable policy tool for promoting growth and debt sustainability. By improving the
functioning of product, labor, and financial markets,
such reforms have the potential to stimulate growth
and reduce debt ratios.1
Beyond the reduction in debt ratios arising from
an increase in GDP, the impact of market reforms on
public debt dynamics is not obvious. By improving
the business environment, reforms can increase the
tax base and generate additional resources. But they
can also lead to a loss of revenue through measures
such as trade tariff reductions. Similarly, borrowing
costs could decline if reforms ease access to international markets and boost external confidence. But
costs could also increase if reforms tackle domestic financial repression or require compensatory
spending, for example, to alleviate adverse distributional effects.
An analysis of 62 emerging market and developing economies during 1970–2014 shows that market
reforms have been associated with both increased GDP
and reduced debt (Figure 3.1.1). A one-standard-­
deviation increase in an indicator of reforms is estimated
to lead to a 0.6 percent increase in real GDP over five
years and a medium-term reduction in the ratio of public debt to GDP of 1.5 percentage points. Importantly,
this means the effect of structural reforms on the debt
ratio is much more than simply a denominator effect.
The findings also suggest that reforms lead to
increased revenues and lower sovereign spreads, but

also higher public consumption, with only a small and
temporary improvement in the overall fiscal balance.
Countries with a more efficient value-added tax tend
to experience greater fiscal gains from reforms.
To protect the fiscal gains from these reforms,
it’s crucial to direct the additional revenue toward
growth-friendly public investments and enhance the
tax base through tax collection efficiency.

Coming Down to Earth: How to Tackle Soaring Public Debt

Box 3.2. Monetary and Fiscal Interactions
At the current juncture of high inflation and tighter
(relative to pre-pandemic) worldwide financial conditions, an increasing number of economies with high
debts are facing difficult trade-offs among inflation,
debt servicing costs, and monetary and fiscal tightening. This box studies monetary and fiscal interactions and finds that the effects of recent increases in
inflation and nominal interest rates on debt service
burdens may be somewhat limited for most advanced
economies and for emerging market and developing
economies with strong institutions. The response
of the effective rate (defined as the interest expense
divided by the previous period’s debt stock)—the rate
that is relevant for servicing debt burdens—to changes
in the inflation rate is considered first. Estimates
show that an increase in consumer price inflation of
1 percentage point lowers the effective real rate by
about 0.5 percentage point on impact and does not
lead to a higher effective real rate across the horizon
(Figure 3.2.1). This is in line with the findings in the
April 2023 Fiscal Monitor, which goes into greater
detail and notes that inflation spikes may durably
reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, but rises in expected
inflation do not.
Central banks around the world have lifted policy
rates considerably since 2021 and put an end to the
era of ultralow nominal rates. What are the implications of the current environment for governments’
debt servicing? An increase in the real spot market rate
for a 10-year government bond of 100 basis points
(bps) is, in fact, associated with an increase in the
effective real rate of only about 20 bps, on average, on
impact (Figure 3.2.1). Among emerging market and
developing economies with weaker institutional frameworks and those without an inflation-targeting central
bank, however, the point estimate increases to about
60 bps. Overall, a rise in spot rates therefore feeds into
effective rates far less than one to one.
One reason behind these findings could be the
increase in average maturity of outstanding debt in
recent years. In addition, central bank credibility may

help keep inflation expectations anchored. Hence,
inflation and higher interest rates permeate debt
service costs only slowly. The share of central government debt maturing in 12 months or less, though, has
increased over the past five years in both advanced and
emerging market and developing economies, which
could leave countries more vulnerable to rollover risks.
Persistent inflationary pressures pose the risk of a
“high for long” interest rate environment. However,
over a longer time frame, and once inflation pressures have subsided, equilibrium real interest rates are
expected to remain low on account of structural forces
(see Chapter 2), which should also help keep real debt
servicing costs in check.

GEOECONOMIC FRAGMENTATION AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT

Supply-chain disruptions and rising geopolitical tensions
have brought the risks and potential benefits and costs
of geoeconomic fragmentation to the center of the policy
debate. This chapter studies how such fragmentation can
reshape the geography of foreign direct investment (FDI)
and, in turn, how FDI fragmentation can affect the
global economy. The recent slowdown in FDI has been
characterized by divergent patterns across host countries,
with flows increasingly concentrated among geopolitically
aligned countries, particularly in strategic sectors. Several
emerging market and developing economies are highly
vulnerable to FDI relocation, given their reliance on FDI
from geopolitically distant countries. In the long term,
FDI fragmentation arising from the emergence of geopolitical blocs can generate large output losses. These losses may
be especially severe for emerging market and developing
economies facing heightened restrictions from advanced
economies, which are their major sources of FDI. Multilateral efforts to preserve global integration are the best
way to reduce the large and widespread economic costs of
FDI fragmentation. When multilateral agreements are not
feasible, multilateral consultations and processes to mitigate the spillover effects of unilateral policies are required.
In a more fragmented world, some countries could reduce
their vulnerability by promoting private sector development, while others could take advantage of the diversion
of investment flows to attract new FDI by undertaking structural reforms and improving infrastructure.

Introduction
Rising geopolitical tensions and the uneven distribution of the gains from globalization have contributed to increasing skepticism toward multilateralism
and to the growing appeal of inward-looking policies

and others 2020; Pastor and Veronesi 2021). Brexit,
trade tensions between the US and China, and Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine pose a challenge to international
relations and could lead to policy-driven reversal of
global economic integration, a process referred to as
geoeconomic fragmentation. This process encompasses different channels, including trade, capital,
and migration flows.1 This chapter focuses on one
specific channel—the fragmentation of foreign direct
investment (FDI), which is cross-border investment
through which foreign investors establish a stable and
long-lasting influence over domestic enterprises.
A slowdown in globalization—often referred to as
“slowbalization”—is not new. For most countries it
dates to the aftermath of the global financial crisis
(Antràs 2021; Baldwin 2022). A decrease in FDI has
been particularly visible, with global FDI declining
from 3.3 percent of GDP in the 2000s to 1.3 percent
between 2018 and 2022 (Figure 4.1; see also
UNCTAD 2022 for an overview of recent trends in
FDI). While a range of factors have contributed to this
protracted phase of slowbalization, the fragmentation
of capital flows along geopolitical fault lines and the
potential emergence of regional geopolitical blocs are
novel elements that could have large negative spillovers
to the global economy.
Firms and policymakers are increasingly looking at
strategies for moving production processes to trusted
countries with aligned political preferences to make
supply chains less vulnerable to geopolitical tensions.2
1Aiyar and others (2023) present signs of geoeconomic fragmentation along different dimensions (for example, trade, capital flows,
and reassessments of geopolitical risk), analyze several channels
through which such fragmentation could propagate through the
global economy, and discuss how the rules-based multilateral system
must adapt to the changing world. See the April 2023 Global
Financial Stability Report for an analysis of the effects of geoeconomic fragmentation on non-FDI flows, with implications for
financial stability and macro volatility.
2The term “reshoring” refers to a country’s transfer of (part of the)
global supply chain back home (or geographically closer to home in
the case of “nearshoring”). “Friend-shoring” limits supply-chain networks and the sourcing of inputs to countries allied with the home
country and trusted partners that share similar values. The chapter
uses these terms in relation to the decision to relocate FDI (rather
than to the more general decision of where to source inputs).

A text-mining analysis of earnings call reports from
a large sample of multinational corporations shows
a sharp spike in firms’ interest in reshoring and
friend-shoring (Figure 4.2), occurring at the same time
that the average geopolitical distance across country
pairs started increasing. Recently, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen (2022) argued that rather than
relying heavily on countries with which the US has
geopolitical tensions, US firms should move toward
friend-shoring of supply chains to a large number of
trusted countries. In Europe, the French government
has been urging the EU to accelerate production
targets, weaken state aid rules, and develop a “Made
in Europe” strategy to counter domestic production
subsidies provided by the US Inflation Reduction Act
(Tamma and Stolton 2023). In China, too, government directives aim to replace imported technology
with local alternatives to reduce dependence on geopolitical rivals (Bloomberg News 2022). Rising interest
in reshoring is a significant reversal of the division
of production pursued through offshoring, driven
predominantly by differences in labor and input costs
(Feenstra 1998; Antràs and Yeaple 2014).
The importance of friend-shoring goes
beyond just announcements and translates into
investment-screening measures motivated by national
security purposes (UNCTAD 2023). Recent large-scale
policies implemented by major countries to strengthen
domestic strategic manufacturing sectors suggest
that a shift in cross-border capital flows is about to

take place. Most notable is a series of recent bills
adopted against the backdrop of rising US-China trade
tensions—such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to
Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act
and the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the
European Chips Act—that could affect multinational
corporations’ production and sourcing strategies,
prompting efforts to reconfigure their supply-chain
networks (Box 4.1).
This reconfiguration of supply chains could potentially strengthen domestic security and help maintain a
technological advantage. It may also increase diversification, provided the existing supply of inputs is
concentrated in a single or a small number of foreign
suppliers, such that domestic and close-country sourcing would increase the number of available options.
However, as most countries exhibit a marked degree
of home bias in sourcing of inputs (see Chapter 4 of
the April 2022 World Economic Outlook), in most cases
reshoring or friend-shoring to existing partners will
likely reduce diversification and make countries more
vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.
This chapter studies how geoeconomic fragmentation could affect the global economy through a shift
in the geographic footprint of FDI. While a growing literature investigates the costs of geoeconomic

fragmentation through trade and technological
decoupling,3 existing work has not yet looked directly
at FDI fragmentation. But this is likely to be a relevant
channel through which the emergence of geopolitical blocs could have global spillovers. In fact, FDI
accounts for a substantial share of domestic capital
stock globally—about 12 percent, on average—and is
generally associated with knowledge transfer to domestic firms and economic growth, especially in emerging
market and developing economies (Alfaro and others
2004; Javorcik 2004; Kose and others 2009). A relocation of FDI closer to source countries could have direct
negative effects on current host economies through
lower capital and technological deepening, as firms
expressing interest in reshoring and friend-shoring
tend to be on average larger, more profitable, and more
knowledge-intensive (Figure 4.3).
Against this backdrop, this chapter starts by looking
for early signs of FDI fragmentation, using detailed
bilateral investment-level data on FDI from 2003
to the end of 2022. It investigates two questions:
(1) Is there any evidence of reallocation of FDI across
countries, indicating that flows are becoming more
fragmented? and (2) Do geopolitical factors contribute
to explaining bilateral FDI flows, so that countries
deepen their integration with friends and reduce
their reliance on foes? The chapter develops a multidimensional index of countries’ vulnerability to FDI
relocation combining information on the geopolitical
distance between source and host countries, share of
strategic sector investment in total FDI inflows, and
degree of market power enjoyed by the host country.
Next, the chapter turns to quantifying the potential
costs of FDI fragmentation and their distribution across
countries. To understand the channels through which a
potential unwinding of FDI could affect host countries, the chapter empirically examines FDI spillovers,
taking both macro- and micro-level approaches. An
extensive literature on the economic effects of FDI on
host countries does not deliver consistent results when
simply looking at aggregate flows (Bénétrix, Pallan, and
Panizza 2022). The chapter extends this literature by
conducting a country-level analysis of the relationship
between GDP growth and FDI separately for horizontal

and others (2022). A related literature looks at the effects of Brexit and
the 2018–19 US-China trade war; see Caliendo and Parro (2021) and

and vertical investment, as the latter is more likely to be
affected by geoeconomic fragmentation. A subsequent
firm-level analysis combines investment-level FDI data
with a large sample of cross-country firm-level surveys
to identify potential spillovers to firm labor productivity
within and across sectors along the value chain.
Finally, the chapter calibrates a number of illustrative hypothetical scenarios to provide a sense of the
possible long-term economic implications of FDI fragmentation using a multiregion dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. It employs scenarios
to explore the distribution of costs and benefits across
economies, including those from spillovers through
external demand and the reallocation of production
capacity. Fragmentation is modeled as a permanent rise
in investment barriers between opposing geopolitical
blocs centered on the two largest economies (China
and the US), with economies pursuing a nonaligned
path potentially facing heightened uncertainty.
The main conclusions from the chapter
are as follows:
•• The recent slowdown in FDI has been characterized by divergent patterns across host countries,
particularly when considering investment in
strategic sectors, like semiconductors. FDI flows
are increasingly concentrated among countries that
are geopolitically aligned. The role of geopolitical
International Monetary Fund | April 2023

alignment in driving the geographic footprint of
FDI is particularly relevant for emerging market and
developing economies and has increased since 2018,
with the resurgence of trade tensions between the
US and China. Thus, if geopolitical tensions were
to increase and countries were to move farther apart
along geopolitical fault lines, FDI is likely to become
more concentrated within blocs of aligned countries.
Efforts to preserve a multilateral dialogue are needed
to keep FDI fragmentation from increasing.
•• Analysis from a multidimensional index of vulnerability to FDI relocation suggests that, on average,
emerging market and developing economies are
more vulnerable to such relocation than advanced
economies. This is mostly because of emerging market and developing economies’ reliance on FDI from
countries with which they are relatively unaligned
geopolitically. Several large emerging markets,
across different regions, show high vulnerabilities to
relocation of FDI, indicating that the fragmentation
scenario is not a risk only for a few countries. As
better regulatory quality is associated with lower
vulnerability, countries could mitigate their exposure
to FDI relocation by introducing policies and regulations to promote private sector development.
•• A further contraction in FDI and a shift in its geographic distribution would likely have large negative
effects on host countries, through lower capital accumulation and technological deepening. The chapter
finds that vertical FDI, more likely to be targeted by
policies aimed at friend-shoring investment in strategic sectors, is associated with economic growth, not
least because of its knowledge-intensive nature. The
entry of multinational corporations also directly benefits domestic firms. In advanced economies, increased
competition from foreign firms pushes domestic firms
to become more productive. In emerging market and
developing economies, domestic suppliers benefit
from technology transfers and increased local demand
for inputs from foreign firms in downstream sectors.
•• Illustrative model-based scenarios suggest that FDI
fragmentation—modeled as a permanent rise in
cross-bloc barriers to importing investment inputs—
could substantially reduce global output, by about
2 percent in the long term. Simulations of various
hypothetical scenarios suggest that the losses are
likely to be unevenly distributed, with emerging
market and developing economies with reduced
access to advanced economies particularly affected,
through both lower capital formation and reduced
94

productivity gains. While the diversion of investment inputs could allow some economies to gain,
such benefits could be significantly offset by spillovers from lower external demand. Alternate scenarios are used to highlight that nonaligned regions
could have some negotiating power vis-à-vis the
geopolitical blocs. However, uncertainty regarding
their alignment could restrict their ability to attract
investment. The estimated output losses highlight
the importance of carefully balancing the strategic
motivations behind reshoring and friend-shoring
against economic costs to the countries themselves
and to third parties, including through multilateral
consultations to reduce uncertainty for bystanders.

Early Signs of FDI Fragmentation
Recent trends point to the emergence of FDI fragmentation. This chapter relies on investment-level data on
new (greenfield) FDI from fDi Markets, which provides
data on about 300,000 investments from the first quarter
of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2022. The richness
of the data—which include information on the source
and host countries and on the sector and purpose of the
investment—allows for zooming in on specific regions,
country pairs, and industries.4 It also permits classification of certain sectors as “strategic”: those for which policymakers may be particularly interested in relocation due
to national and economic security interests.5 Throughout
the chapter, the number of greenfield foreign direct
investments is used as the measure of FDI.6
4As the data do not show divestment, the chapter studies the

geographic footprint of new direct investments. Once aggregated
at the host country–year level, the investment-level data are highly
correlated with gross FDI inflows, and the distributions of the two
show a large degree of overlap, as also shown by Toews and Vézina
(2022). As data on mergers and acquisitions are not available from
the same data source, the analysis is based exclusively on greenfield
investments. New (greenfield) investments are more numerous than
mergers and acquisitions, especially in emerging market and developing economies; are more highly correlated with aggregate data on
FDI; and are less frequently concentrated in tax havens. To mitigate
the risk that findings are affected by phantom FDI (Damgaard,
Elkjaer, and Johannesen 2019), the robustness of the analysis is
tested excluding FDI from and to international financial centers.

are available at www​.imf​.org/​en/​Publications/​WEO.
5The chapter defines strategic sectors at the three-digit industry
level. More details are discussed in Online Annex 4.1.
6As investment values in the fDi Markets data set are often estimated,
the chapter’s main analysis relies on the number of investments; in the
chapter, a change in FDI refers to a change in the number of greenfield
foreign direct investments. Online Annex 4.1 shows that the main
results are robust to the use of investment values.

Many factors likely contributed to the slowdown
in FDI before the pandemic, such as increasing
automation and other technological changes (Alonso
and others 2022). Yet some recent patterns point to
increased FDI fragmentation as geopolitical tensions
and inward-looking policies have gained importance.
The flow of strategic FDI to Asian countries started
to decline in 2019 and has recovered only mildly
in recent quarters. By contrast, flows of strategic
investments to the US and Europe have proved more
resilient. As a result, by the fourth quarter of 2022,
a significant gap emerged between new investment
directed to these regions, with strategic FDI to Europe
about twice that going to Asian countries (Figure 4.4,
panel 1). Fragmentation—and specifically the lack of
recovery of FDI to China—is even more apparent for

foreign investment in R&D and in specific strategic industries, such as the semiconductor industry
(Figure 4.4, panel 2), which both the US and the
European Union have targeted with policies directed at
strengthening domestic production and reducing the
vulnerability from unaligned foreign suppliers.
These patterns are indicative of a more general
process of reallocation of FDI flows across countries.
FDI declined in the post-pandemic period from the
second quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2022 by
almost 20 percent compared to the post–global financial
crisis pre-pandemic average. But this decline has been
extremely uneven across regions, with the emergence of
relative winners and losers as both source and host of FDI
(Figure 4.5). Asia became less relevant both as a source
and host, losing market share vis-à-vis almost all other
regions. Notably, FDI to and from China declined by
even more than the Asian average, although the persistent
effect of the pandemic and prolonged lockdowns could
also have contributed to the fall in foreign investment.
In other regions, such as the US and emerging Europe,
greenfield FDI declined less and, in some cases, even
increased (for example, inflows to emerging Europe).

Standardization (ISO) country codes. “TWN” refers to “Taiwan Province of China.”

In regard to outward FDI from the US, the bottom row of Figure 4.5 shows that US FDI to China
declined by much more than the average global decline.
At the same time, US FDI to other regions—and
particularly to emerging Europe—was more resilient.
This shift in the composition of outward US FDI can
be analyzed in detail, looking at differences between
host economies (Figure 4.6). Among major Asian and
European recipients of US FDI, some of the relative
winners (for example, Canada, Korea) are politically
closer to the US than the relative losers (for example,
China, Vietnam). This suggests that geopolitical factors
have driven part of the shift in FDI flows in recent
years. The next section investigates this issue in detail.

FDI Is Becoming More Responsive to Geopolitical Factors
Rising geopolitical tensions are a key driver of
FDI fragmentation, as bilateral FDI is increasingly
concentrated among countries that share similar
geopolitical views (Figure 4.7). This chapter measures
geopolitical alignment between countries using the
“ideal point distance” proposed by Bailey, Strezhnev,
and Voeten (2017), which is based on the similarity

of ­voting patterns at the United Nations General
Assembly.7 As transportation costs and geographic
frictions also influence FDI decisions (Alfaro and
Chen 2018; Ramondo, Rodríguez-Clare, and Tintelnot
2015), it is informative to compare their roles with
that of geopolitical alignment. The share of FDI
among countries that are geopolitically aligned is larger
than the share going to countries geographically close,
suggesting that geopolitical preferences play a key role
as a driver of FDI. In addition, the importance of geopolitical alignment has increased over the last decade,
7Recent analysis of geoeconomic fragmentation looks at recent
votes, such as the UN General Assembly vote on Resolution ES-11/1
on aggression against Ukraine on March 2, 2022 (Chapter 3 of
the October 2022 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific;
Javorcik and others 2022). However, this chapter looks at the role of
geopolitical alignment over a longer period: the last 20 years. In this
respect, the ideal point distance has the advantage of being comparable over time. Although the ideal point distance is widely used in
political science and in economics, scholars have proposed alternative
measures. The findings of the chapter are robust to the use of the
S score used in the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report and
proposed by Signorino and Ritter (1999), who assign numeric values
to voting behavior in the UN General Assembly and calculate the
degree of disagreement between two countries by computing the
sum of squared differences of these values.

Geoeconomic Fragmentation and Foreign Direct Investment

and increased more steeply than the importance of geographic distance, especially for FDI in strategic sectors.
The role of geopolitical alignment is significant and
economically relevant, particularly for emerging market
and developing economies, in a gravity model that controls for other potential drivers of FDI flows. In the baseline specification, an increase in the ideal point distance
from the first to the third quartile of its distribution
(equivalent to moving the distance from that between
Canada and Japan to that between Canada and Jordan)
is associated with a decline in FDI between countries of
about 17 percent. This average effect is much stronger
when emerging market and developing economies are
either a source or a host country. Moreover, since 2018,
coincident with increasing trade tensions between China
and the US, geopolitical factors have become more relevant to FDI flows. Finally, the analysis suggests that these
factors matter more in regard to investments in strategic
sectors (Figure 4.8). Thus, if countries move farther apart
along geopolitical fault lines, FDI is likely to become
more concentrated within blocs of geopolitically aligned
countries. Moreover, fragmentation risks are not confined
to FDI flows. Zooming in on non-FDI flows points out
a sharp increase in countries’ exposure to financial fragmentation risk, which could trigger a significant global
reallocation of capital in response to a rise in geopolitical
tensions (Box 4.2). Such tensions matter significantly
for cross-border portfolio allocation and could cause a
sudden reversal of cross-border capital flows, especially
in emerging market and developing economies (see the
April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report).
The findings reported in Figure 4.8 are based on a
gravity model that takes bilateral FDI as the dependent variable and controls for standard push-and-pull
factors, including a set of time-varying fixed effects for
source and host countries (Kox and Rojas-Romagosa
2020).8 To minimize the possibility that the coefficient

8The analysis is based on estimating the following specification:
​= f​(​α ​IPD​sdt−1​+ β ​Gravity​ sd​+ ​τ​st​+ ​υ​dt​, ​ε​sdt​)​, where bilateral FDI flows
(measured by the number of investments) from the source country s
to the host country d in year t is a function of the lagged value of IPD
(the ideal point distance) between countries d and s. As is standard in
gravity models, the specification controls for the geographic distance
between source and host countries and other standard gravity controls,
and absorbs any time-varying unobservable push-and-pull factors,
adding source country × year and host country × year fixed effects.
These fixed effects would capture, for instance, business cycle dynamics that could push FDI outflows from a source country and attract
inflows into a host country. As, by construction, most of the ​FDI​sdt​
cells are 0, the model is estimated using Poisson pseudo-maximum
likelihood (Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006). Standard errors are
clustered at the country-pair level.

Greater geopolitical distance is associated with less foreign direct investment,

on the index of geopolitical distance captures the
role of other factors that could drive FDI, the model
is augmented to include measures of geographic,
cultural, and institutional distance and a historical
measure of colonial ties. As expected, the inclusion
of these variables—which are indeed associated with
bilateral FDI flows—reduces the size of the coefficient
of the ideal point distance, which however remains
statistically and economically significant. The findings
are also robust to considering FDI in manufacturing
or services separately; excluding financial centers or
China; controlling for the announcement and implementation of bilateral trade barriers, for the volume of

chapter develops a multidimensional index of vulnerability. It combines three subindices, based on three
dimensions relevant to geoeconomic fragmentation:
(1) the geopolitical distance between source and
host countries, (2) the degree of market power that
host countries have in each industry in which they
receive FDI, and (3) the strategic component of the
stock of FDI.
•• The geopolitical index captures the idea that the
greater the geopolitical distance between source
and host countries, the greater the vulnerability
to friend-shoring. The index is calculated for each
host country by multiplying the share of investment from each source country by the geopolitical distance between host and source countries.
Given that most countries receive much of their
FDI from advanced economies and given that
those economies are geopolitically closer to one
another than to emerging market and developing economies, these economies are more geopolitically vulnerable than advanced economies
(Figure 4.9, panel 1).
•• Countries with high market shares in trade of a
given sector may be less vulnerable to relocation
pressures in that sector, as foreign investors may
have fewer options for relocating investment. The
index of market power captures this dimension by
treating FDI in a particular sector as less vulnerable
if the host country is among the top 10 exporters in
that sector. By contrast, FDI in host countries that
are not among the top 10 exporters in that sector is
treated as fully vulnerable. Though the vast majority
of economies show low levels of protection from
market power, some large economies (for example, China, Germany, US) do enjoy some level of
protection, being large exporters in many sectors
(Figure 4.9, panel 2).
•• The strategic index measures the share of inward
FDI in strategic sectors. This dimension of vulnerability shows substantial overlap between advanced
and emerging market and developing economies
(Figure 4.9, panel 3).
The geopolitical and strategic dimensions of
vulnerability are broadly uncorrelated and capture
distinct aspects of countries’ vulnerability to geoeconomic fragmentation (Figure 4.10). Whereas geopolitical vulnerability is concentrated among emerging
market and developing economies—as shown by the
disproportionate share of red squares in the figure

to the right of the vertical line denoting the median
geopolitical index—many large advanced economies,
including the US, Germany, and Korea, are in the
top half of the distribution of strategic vulnerability.
The cluster of countries particularly vulnerable along
both dimensions includes some large emerging market
economies, such as Brazil, China, and India, but also
several other emerging market economies, suggesting
that FDI fragmentation is likely to be an issue for a
large set of countries.
The three subindices are combined to construct
an aggregate index. The aggregate index adds the
strategic and geopolitical dimensions, with the latter
multiplied by the market power index. Multiplying
the geopolitical dimension by the market power
index—bounded between 0 and 1—allows for a
dampening of the geopolitical vulnerability component. This captures the idea that multinationals
that would like to move their investments out of
geopolitically distant countries will find it more
difficult to do so if the host country is a key player
in the global market in that sector. The strategic
dimension is added to the combined geopolitical and
market power component, as it reflects the heightened vulnerability of investments in specific sectors
in all host countries, not only those that are geopolitically distant, and such sectors are more likely to
be targeted with reshoring policies, offsetting any
protection from market power.9 Overall, emerging
market and developing economies are more vulnerable to FDI fragmentation than advanced economies,
even if there is large variation in the distribution of
the index and some overlap between advanced and
emerging market economies (for instance, 14 percent
of emerging market and developing economies have
a vulnerability index lower than the median for
advanced economies). The distribution across regions
shows the better position of Europe, while all other
regions show higher and similar levels of vulnerability
(Figure 4.9, panel 4).
While the aggregate vulnerability index is
intended to describe exposures of existing stocks to
relocation as they stand, policy measures could help
reduce future vulnerabilities. Beyond multilateral
9Rather than simply combining a host country’s scores for the
three subindices, the aggregate index is built up from the sector–
source country level, such that market power offsets geopolitical
distance only for sectors in which the host economy is among the
top 10 exporters. The methodology for constructing the vulnerability
indices is discussed in Online Annex 4.2.

efforts to preserve cooperation, domestic policies
could also help, allowing economies to mitigate
some risks even in a geopolitically tense world.
Figure 4.11 suggests that stronger regulatory quality
tends to be associated with lower aggregate vulnerability to relocation of FDI. Improved regulatory
quality tends also to be associated with higher
exports, which could offer protection against relocation pressures.

FDI Spillovers to Host Countries
Besides direct effects on job creation and capital
formation, inward FDI could have spillover effects
on domestic firms through technology diffusion,
backward and forward linkages, and productivity
gains from increased competition.10 When it comes
to empirical results, however, the effects are mixed
(Görg and Greenaway 2004; Bénétrix, Pallan, and
Panizza 2022). Cross-country studies reveal that the
effect of inward FDI is uneven and depends on host

and Saggi (1998) for the technology spillover effect, and Barba

countries’ human capital (Borensztein, De Gregorio,
and Lee 1998), institutional quality (Kose and others
2009), and financial development (Alfaro and others
2004). The lack of consistent findings may stem from
FDI heterogeneity along the mode of entry, the type
of investment, and the relationship between foreign
and domestic firms. The evidence is generally more
informative for specific types of FDI and spillovers
along the value chain (Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare
2010). Hence, the analysis here explores two important
dimensions: the distinction between horizontal and
vertical FDI and differences in spillovers within and
across industries.11

Horizontal versus Vertical FDI
Horizontal FDI refers to foreign firms entering a
country to directly serve local markets. By contrast,
vertical FDI takes place when foreign firms enter
a country to produce inputs that will be supplied
11The interpretation of the results should take into account the
potential endogeneity of FDI, which is in part addressed by using
lagged values of FDI and including fixed effects (especially in the
firm-level analysis).

100

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

to affiliated firms.12 This distinction is particularly
relevant in the context of geoeconomic fragmentation,
given that vertical FDI is likely more exposed to FDI
fragmentation risk than horizontal FDI. Higher trade
barriers, for instance, would make horizontal FDI
more attractive—as it could be a substitute for trade
(Brainard 1997)—while making vertical FDI less
attractive. Moreover, vertical FDI is often centered on
advanced technology embodied in input production
and thus is more likely to be the target of policies
aimed at reshoring strategic production.
Vertical FDI is positively associated with economic
growth, as it is concentrated among intermediate-goods
producers that adopt more sophisticated (and
skill-intensive) technology (Atalay, Hortaçsu, and
Syverson 2014; Ramondo, Rappoport, and Ruhl
2016). This is not the case for horizontal FDI, more
likely to be found among final-goods producers, which
tend to transfer simple (and labor-intensive) assembly
technology to host countries (Figure 4.12). These findings are obtained from cross-country growth regressions, which are estimated separately for countries
more likely to receive vertical or horizontal FDI.13

Spillovers within and across Industries
The effects of the entry of a multinational corporation on domestic firms could be different depending on whether those firms are in the same sector
or in other sectors—either upstream or downstream
along the value chain. For instance, consider Toshiba
setting up a chip-making plant in China. The Chinese
chipmakers are directly affected by the entry of
Toshiba (within-industry spillovers), as the increased
competition can either provide local firms with a
greater incentive to innovate, and thus to become
more productive, or crowd out local firms by stealing
12The Samsung Electronics smartphone factory in India is
an example of horizontal FDI, as most of its products are sold
to Indian customers, whereas its semiconductor factory in
Vietnam is an example of vertical FDI, as its products are sold
mainly to Samsung’s own affiliates worldwide. Other relatively
minor types of FDI include export-platform FDI (for example,
Volkswagen’s plant in Mexico, which sells mostly to the US) and
export-supporting FDI (for example, Toyota Financial Services
USA, which offers US consumers financing options to facilitate
export sales from Japan).
13This classification is based on detailed foreign subsidiary–level
sales information from the Export-Import Bank of Korea. The estimation results are robust to alternative classifications based on parent
and subsidiary firms’ sector affiliations from Orbis. The methodology
and the results are described in more detail in Online Annex 4.3.

market share (Markusen and Venables 1999). At the
same time, there are spillovers to other industries
(cross-industry spillovers): Chinese silicon producers are also affected as they are big suppliers to the
chip-making industry (backward linkages). Moreover,
Chinese firms in the automobile industry will also be
affected as they are heavy users of semiconductor chips
(forward linkages).
Results based on a large sample of firm-level data
from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys covering
over 120,000 firms in 150 countries from 2006 to
2021 show positive spillovers to domestic firms in
the same industry (Figure 4.13, top graph). Positive
within-industry spillovers to firms’ labor productivity
are confined to advanced economies, where firms react
to fiercer competition from multinational corporations by becoming more productive. In the case of
cross-industry spillovers, domestic suppliers benefit
from the entry of foreign firms in downstream sectors,
as the latter may source inputs locally and increase
local demand for inputs produced by domestic firms.
Local suppliers may also benefit from learning by
doing via direct contact with foreign buyers with
better technology. These positive spillovers to domestic

suppliers are driven by FDI in emerging market and
developing economies.14 By contrast, there is no evidence of spillovers to domestic users, even in emerging market and developing economies. This could be
because foreign firms in upstream sectors mostly sell
abroad, implying limited scope for positive technology spillovers via direct contact with local buyers
(Figure 4.13, bottom two graphs).

A Model-Based Quantification of the Costs of
FDI Fragmentation
To investigate the long-term implications of potential FDI fragmentation, this section uses a multiregion
DSGE model to explore possible scenarios.15 The simulations focus on fragmentation of investment flows
14These findings are consistent with those of Mercer-Blackman,
Xiang, and Khan (2021) on a smaller sample covering mostly
Asian countries.
15The analysis uses the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal Model, further elaborated in Online Annex 4.4. A detailed
exposition of the model and its properties may be found in Kumhof
and others (2010) and Anderson and others (2013).

arising from permanent barriers between geopolitical
blocs, as well as heightened uncertainty about the geopolitical alignment of different regions. The analysis,
and the various hypothetical scenarios, are intended to
illustrate some of the key economic mechanisms likely
to be at play and to provide a sense of overall output
losses and the distribution of costs and benefits across
economies, including those from spillovers through
external demand and the reallocation of production
capacity. The geopolitical coalitions considered are for
analytical purposes only and are not intended to indicate alignment choices countries are likely to make.
The analysis focuses on two key roles of FDI:
its contribution to capital formation in host economies and the transmission of technologies and
productivity-enhancing management practices from
advanced to emerging market and developing economies. The model does not have explicit foreign
ownership of productive capital, and thus there is no
direct mapping to FDI.16 The bilateral cross-border
flow of inputs into investment is instead used as a
proxy, since similarly to reductions in FDI, barriers to
the flow of such inputs directly reduce capital formation. The scenarios illustrate a 50 percent reduction
of such flows. Alongside, empirical estimates of the
correlation between FDI flows and labor productivity
are used to discipline the associated productivity losses
from a reduction in such flows. The analysis complements the literature, which has focused on the impact
of fragmentation through trade and associated knowledge spillovers (Cerdeiro and others 2021; Eppinger
and others 2021; Góes and Bekkers 2022; Javorcik and
others 2022), although a full analysis of the interaction
between different aspects of geoeconomic fragmentation is beyond the scope of this chapter. Box 4.3
discusses new evidence suggesting that the fragmentation of international trade as a result of geopolitical
tensions could lead to lower output in most countries,
with emerging market and developing economies more
adversely affected than other country groups.
The simulations center on decoupling between the
two largest economies—China and the US—which is
likely to be the most economically consequential form
of fragmentation. Although how other countries and
regions might align themselves in such a decoupling
remains unclear and will depend on a multitude of

factors (for example, strength of existing trade and
financial links and national security considerations),
scenario analysis is used to highlight the implications
of different geopolitical-alignment choices for economic outcomes.
The model allows for up to eight regions. China,
the EU+ (that is, the EU and Switzerland), and the
US are assigned their own regions, as the policy
choices of these economies are likely to shape global
fragmentation scenarios. To illustrate the interaction
between alignment choices and economic outcomes for
emerging market and developing economies, including through investment diversion, a region is assigned
to Latin America and the Caribbean and another to
India and Indonesia, two representative Asian emerging market and developing economies with relatively
neutral measures of geopolitical distance from the US
and China. The remaining three regions comprise the
rest of southeast Asia, other advanced economies (for
example, Australia, Canada, Japan, UK), and the rest
of the world (for example, central Asia, Middle East,
Russia, sub-Saharan Africa).
While geopolitical-alignment choices are highly
uncertain, to discipline the analysis, the chapter constructs a baseline hypothetical scenario for alignments
using the ideal point distance. Relative distances from
either the US or China, based on the latest ideal point
distance data, are used to assign regions to geopolitical blocs aligned with either the US or China, or as
nonaligned. Additional scenarios, focusing on different
alignment choices for the EU+, India and Indonesia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, explore
the interaction between geopolitical alignment and
economic outcomes (Table 4.1). In reality, geopolitical alignments are not givens and likely require the
balancing of multiple considerations (beyond the scope
of this chapter) under frictions and uncertainty.
In the first scenario, in which the world splinters into a US-centered bloc and a China-centered
bloc, and with both India and Indonesia and Latin
America and the Caribbean remaining nonaligned,
global output is about 1 percent lower after five years
(relative to the no-fragmentation scenario). Global
output losses increase as the impact on capital stocks
and productivity from lower investment input flows
cumulate, with long-term output lower by 2 percent
(Figure 4.14). Output losses are generally larger in
the emerging-market-dominated China bloc, as these
regions face heightened barriers to the major sources of
investments, namely, advanced economies. The losses

are also nonnegligible for the US bloc, however, driven
by some members’ strong links to China (such as Japan
and Korea in the other advanced economies region and
Germany in the EU+ region).
For the nonaligned economies, the impact depends
on the outcome of two competing channels. On the
one hand, the substantial reduction in global activity
reduces external demand, weighing on net exports
and investment. On the other hand, these regions also
benefit from the diversion of investment flows, which—
if sufficiently large—could boost investment and
output. The importance of the second channel increases
with the ease with which investment goods from
different regions can be substituted for one another by
the importing region. In the benchmark assumption
for the elasticity of substitution across source regions of
investment inputs, the first channel dominates, and the
nonaligned regions experience a small drop in output
(Figure 4.14, darker bars). Alongside the benchmark
case, an alternative case uses a higher elasticity of substitution (double in value). In the alternative case, higher
diversion yields a small net increase in investment and
output (Figure 4.14, lighter bars).17
In reality, a geoeconomically fragmented world might
entail substantial policy uncertainty for economies that
try to remain open to both geopolitical blocs. Rather
than having their nonaligned status accepted, these
economies may need to walk a narrow path amid pressures from both sides, with the attendant risk of falling
out with one bloc or the other. This type of policy
17Similar to the cases of India and Indonesia and Latin America
and the Caribbean, losses are significantly lower for other regions,
such as southeast Asia, if they are also nonaligned, as shown in
additional simulations in Online Annex 4.4.

uncertainty, in which investors perceive a risk that
current policy stances toward that economy could shift
radically in the future, can act as an economically meaningful barrier to trade and investment, as documented
in the literature (for example, Handley and Limão
2022). While the exact degree of such uncertainty in
a hypothetical fragmented future is impossible to pin
down, a case involving a high level of uncertainty—in
which investors in both blocs perceive a 50 percent
chance that the nonaligned region will fall in with the
opposing bloc over the long term—is a natural analytical complement to the baseline no-uncertainty scenario
already discussed.18 Specifically, investors behave as if
investment input flows to (from) these regions face half
the barriers faced by regions in the opposing bloc. As
shown in Figure 4.15, losses are significantly amplified
for nonaligned regions under such uncertainty, as they
face reduced inflows from both blocs, with some negative spillovers to other regions as well.
Alternative alignment choices highlight their significant impact on outcomes. For example, a world
in which the EU+ remains nonaligned entails significantly lower costs for both itself and the China
bloc economies. However, the EU+ might face
heavy costs if such a policy approach significantly
raises the possibility of barriers between itself and
the US—due to greater uncertainty about its future
alignment (Figure 4.16, panel 1). Under the baseline, the two nonaligned regions generally tend to be
18The scenario illustrates the case with India and Indonesia and
the Latin America and Caribbean regions remaining nonaligned
indefinitely, but with investors perceiving a risk they will pick a side
in the future (and therefore face the associated barriers). Alongside
the 50–50 scenario presented here, Online Annex 4.4 discusses a
range of possible levels of uncertainty.

worse off when aligning with either bloc, as opposed
to remaining open to both. However, given that the
advanced-economy-dominated US bloc is the major
source of investment flows, they are better off joining
this bloc if forced to choose, especially if they were to
face uncertainty otherwise (Figure 4.16, panel 2).
Blocs’ incentive to attract emerging market and
developing economies might give nonaligned regions
some bargaining power but could also generate the
type of damaging uncertainty that reduces investment
(Figure 4.17). Unsurprisingly, existing bloc members
would gain when their bloc attracts the nonaligned
regions and lose when nonaligned regions join the opposing bloc. The gain to the existing bloc members could
outweigh the losses to the joining regions, suggesting
some scope for transfers to implement such an outcome.
Potential transfers could take several forms, including
favorable trade and investment treatment or fiscal measures to encourage friend-shoring to target economies.19

The opposing bloc would likely want to avoid such an

coordination frictions, further underscoring the uncertainty that could itself weigh on investment.

Policy Implications
The findings of this chapter contribute to understanding how fragmentation pressures may already be
affecting investment flows across economies, as well
as the long-term implications for the global economy
if such pressures lead to a substantial relocation of
FDI. Vulnerabilities to FDI fragmentation are broadly
shared across many emerging market and developing
economies, and advanced economies are not immune,
particularly those with significant FDI stocks in
strategic sectors. As vulnerabilities can also extend to
non-FDI flows (see the April 2023 Global Financial
Stability Report), a rise in political tensions could trigger large reallocation of capital flows at the global level,
with effects particularly pronounced for emerging market and developing economies. The chapter’s analysis

suggests that a fragmented global economy is likely
to be a poorer one. While there may be relative—and
possibly absolute—winners from diversion, such gains
are subject to substantial uncertainty.
The chapter does not attempt to measure the success
of the policies driving geoeconomic fragmentation in
meeting the objectives often ascribed to them, such as
enhancing national security or maintaining a technological advantage over rival countries, especially in
strategic sectors. Instead, its analysis highlights that
the pursuit of these objectives entails large economic
costs, not just for a country’s rivals and (possibly) other
nonaligned countries, but also for the country itself
and countries aligned with it. These costs need to be
considered carefully.
In regard to policies, the large and widespread
economic costs from strategic decoupling provide a
rationale for a robust defense of global integration, at a
time when several actors are advocating more barriers
and inward-looking policies. For instance, increasing

diversification in international sourcing of inputs
away from domestic sources can make supply chains
more resilient to shocks (see Chapter 4 of the April
2022 World Economic Outlook), without imposing
costs on the world economy. At the same time, the
current rules-based multilateral system must adapt to
the changing world economy and should be complemented by credible “guardrails” to mitigate global
spillovers and by domestic policies targeted at those
adversely affected by global integration (Aiyar and
others 2023).
As policy uncertainty amplifies losses from fragmentation, especially for nonaligned countries, effort
should be devoted to minimizing such uncertainty.
Improving information sharing through multilateral
dialogue would support this goal. In particular, the
development of a framework for international consultations (for instance, on the use of subsidies to provide
incentives for reshoring or friend-shoring of FDI)
could help identify unintended consequences. It could
also mitigate cross-border spillovers by reducing uncertainty and promoting transparency on policy options.
Finally, in a more geopolitically tense world, countries can reduce their vulnerability to FDI relocation
by implementing policies and regulations to promote private sector development. Moreover, a more

fragmented world in which large economies implement
policies to promote friend-shoring of FDI could be
an opportunity for some countries to benefit from
diversion of investment flows by attracting new FDI.
Measures that can increase countries’ attractiveness as
investment destinations include undertaking structural

reforms (Campos and Kinoshita 2010), establishing
investment promotion agencies to reduce information asymmetries and ease bureaucratic procedures
(Harding and Javorcik 2011; Crescenzi, Di Cataldo,
and Giua 2021), and improving infrastructure (Chen
and Lin 2020).

Geoeconomic Fragmentation and Foreign Direct Investment

Box 4.1. Rising Trade Tensions
This box provides a summary and timeline of recent
events behind US-China trade tensions, one of the
major drivers behind the rising risk of geoeconomic
fragmentation.
China’s accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 2001, following its ambitious economic
reforms of the 1990s, was a pivotal milestone, with
world trade volumes almost doubling since then
and China becoming the world’s top exporter and
second-largest economy. However, trade tensions
have been growing over the subsequent years as
China’s rapid export growth has affected segments

of European and US industry. As China’s economic
reforms slowed and even reversed, major trading
partners became increasingly concerned by the
economic role of the state in domestic and export
markets, including technology transfer practices
and the footprint of state-owned enterprises with
an international presence. The inability of WTO
members to agree on reforms in these and other
sensitive areas has exacerbated trade tensions (Aiyar
and others 2023).
The US imposition of tariffs against China in July
2018 triggered an immediate Chinese response and
was followed by rounds of back-and-forth escalations (Figure 4.1.1). The Phase One trade agreement

between the two countries, signed in early 2020,
helped avert further escalation but did little to reverse
the increase in trade restrictions. Tensions have subsequently widened to a new technological front, with
the US explicitly aiming to hinder China’s advancement in sectors such as semiconductors and green
energy equipment. For example, the US has imposed
export controls to restrict China’s access to advanced
computing and semiconductor items. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors
(CHIPS) and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA) aim to advance US global leadership in
key technologies by imposing high domestic-content
requirements. Meanwhile, because of the ongoing US
blockage of WTO Appellate Body appointments, most

108

disputes are being left unresolved, undercutting the
value of trade rules.
Recent initiatives, and the uncertainties surrounding
them, have the potential to reshape global value chains
along geopolitical lines and have already begun to
affect production and sourcing strategies. For example,
the proposed US Chip 4 alliance with three key Asian
economies seeks to set up a semiconductor industry
supply chain independent of China. Other major
economies are also reacting as the case for more active,
inward-looking regional industrial policies gains prominence. For example, the EU’s proposed European
Chips Act aims to boost the bloc’s semiconductor
industry to 20 percent of global production capacity
by 2030, with more than €43 billion in investments.

This box complements the analysis in the chapter by
constructing a new measure of financial exposure to
fragmentation risk, defined as the stock of non–foreign
direct investment (FDI) foreign assets (liabilities)
invested in (borrowed from) countries with diverging
geopolitical views, for major advanced and emerging
market economies.
Cross-border non-FDI financial linkages are constructed using IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey (CPIS) statistics and Bank for International
Settlements Locational Banking Statistics. Since a large
share of positions in the CPIS are booked to financial
centers, bilateral portfolio holdings are first reallocated
to their proper source and host countries following
Coppola and others (2021). Bank and portfolio investments are then aggregated to derive bilateral foreign
assets and liabilities for 38 countries during 2001–21
whose GDP accounts for 86 percent of world GDP.
These positions are combined with bilateral measures
of political proximity as captured by the ideal point
distance, normalized into a continuous variable that
takes the value 1 for the politically closest country
and 0 for the most distant country. Bilateral holdings
are then weighted by the political proximity index to
generate a politically discounted measure of foreign
assets and liabilities. The exposure to fragmentation
is defined as the difference between undiscounted positions and their politically weighted counterparts and
captures the stock of assets (or liabilities) that could be
at risk in a fragmentation scenario.
Exposures are large and have roughly doubled over
the past 20 years. While gross foreign investment positions (assets plus liabilities) as a share of GDP have
more than doubled since 2001, politically weighted
positions have not grown as fast, suggesting that capital has been increasingly invested in (borrowed from)
countries with political views that are further apart
(Figure 4.2.1, panel 1). This is particularly the case for
advanced economies, but it is also the case for emerging markets. Exposures vary significantly across the
Group of Twenty (G20) (Figure 4.2.1, panel 2). They

Investments Statistics Survey; and IMF staff calculations.

for Standardization (ISO) country codes. AEs = advanced

are concentrated on the asset side in advanced economies and on the liability side in emerging markets.
In aggregate, exposures have now reached 42 percent
of GDP, or 24 percent of all non-FDI cross-border
holdings. Therefore, a rise in political tensions could
trigger a significant reallocation of capital at the global
level, although exposures vary significantly across the
G20 (see Online Annex 4.5).

This box presents new evidence that trade fragmentation could lower output for most countries, especially
for emerging market and developing economies. To
assess countries’ exposure to geoeconomic fragmentation in trade, the box estimates the impact of geopolitical alignment on sector-level bilateral trade data for
189 countries (in 10 broad manufacturing sectors) using
structural gravity regressions. These estimates show that
divergences in individual countries’ geopolitical alignment act as a barrier to trade. This effect is concentrated
in some sectors, notably food, but also in transportation
equipment and other manufacturing, which account
for a large share of foreign direct investment (FDI)–
intensive global value chain trade (Figure 4.3.1).
These estimates are used to calibrate a multicountry,
multisector general equilibrium trade model to gauge
the macroeconomic impact of a fragmentation scenario
defined as an increase in alignment among countries
within the US, China, and nonaligned blocs, which
reduces the alignment across the blocs, and a doubling of the estimated sensitivity of trade barriers to
geopolitical alignment. Countries are assigned to blocs
based on whether their current geopolitical treaties are
stronger with the US, stronger with China, or equally
strong with both.1 Three main factors drive countries’
exposure to geoeconomic fragmentation: (1) economy
size: a given rise in trade barriers is more damaging to smaller economies (in terms of population
and GDP), which tend to rely more on international
trade; (2) comparative advantage: fragmentation has a
greater effect on countries that import in sectors with
trade barriers more sensitive to geopolitical alignment;
and (3) geoeconomic alignment: fragmentation is more
damaging, for a given bloc membership, to countries
that are not closely aligned with either of the world’s
two major economies.
While geoeconomic fragmentation leads to income
losses for most countries, it hurts emerging market and

Note: Bars show estimates from sector-level gravity
regressions on 2017–19 average trade values, with importer

is measured by the foreign-treaty s-score from ATOP (Leeds
and others 2002). A one-standard-deviation decrease in
geopolitical alignment corresponds roughly to the difference
between two average North Atlantic Treaty Organization
members and two average nonmembers. Pet./Chem./

developing economies more than advanced economies.
For the median emerging market economy in Africa
and central Asia, real income losses due to geoeconomic fragmentation are more than twice as large
as for the median advanced economy (Figure 4.3.2).
This is primarily because these regions comprise many
emerging market and developing economies that are
small in economic size and relatively unaligned with
major geopolitical blocs.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises eight
sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data and
Conventions, Country Notes, Classification
of Countries, General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification,
Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions underlying the estimates and projections for
2023–24. The second section briefly describes the
changes to the database and statistical tables since
the October 2022 World Economic Outlook (WEO).
The third section offers a general description of the
data and the conventions used for calculating country group composites. The fourth section presents
selected key information for each country. The fifth
section summarizes the classification of countries in
the various groups presented in the WEO, and the
sixth section explains that classification in further
detail. The seventh section provides information on
methods and reporting standards for the member
countries’ national account and government finance
indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. (Statistical Appendix A is included
here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at
www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO.)
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through March 28, 2023. The
figures for 2023–24 are shown with the same degree
of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree
of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels measured during February 15, 2023–March 15,
2023. For 2023 and 2024 these assumptions imply
average US dollar–special drawing right conversion
rates of 1.334 and 1.333, US dollar–euro conversion
rates of 1.063 and 1.054, and yen–US dollar conversion rates of 135.4 and 137.4, respectively.

It is assumed that the price of oil will average
$73.13 a barrel in 2023 and $68.90 a barrel in 2024.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 5.1 percent in 2023 and 4.5 percent in 2024,
that for the euro area will average 2.8 percent in 2023
and 3.0 percent in 2024, and that for Japan will average
–0.1 percent in 2023 and 0.0 percent in 2024. Further
it is assumed that the 10-year government bond yield for
the United States will average 3.8 percent in 2023 and
3.6 percent in 2024, that for the euro area will average
2.5 percent in 2023 and 2.8 percent in 2024, and that
for Japan will average 0.6 percent in 2023 and 2024.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A ROCK Y RECOVERY

As a reminder, in regard to the introduction of the
euro, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the
euro and currencies of the member countries adopting
the euro are as shown on the previous page. Unless
otherwise noted, these fixed conversion rates were
decided by the Council of the European Union effective as of January 1, 1999. See Box 5.4 of the October
1998 WEO as well for details on how the conversion
rates were established.

What’s New
• Beginning with the April 2023 WEO, ASEAN-5
comprises the five ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) founding member nations: Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
• On January 1, 2023, Croatia became the 20th
country to join the euro area. Data for Croatia are
now included in aggregates for the euro area and for
advanced economies and relevant subgroups.
• For Ecuador, fiscal sector projections are excluded
from publication for 2023–28 because of ongoing
program discussions.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented in
the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version of the
System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The IMF’s
sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual and Compilation Guide, and the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014)—have
been aligned with the SNA 2008. These standards

116

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’ external
positions, financial sector stability, and public sector
fiscal positions. The process of adapting country data to
the new standards begins in earnest when the manuals
are released. However, full concordance with the manuals is ultimately dependent on the provision by national
statistical compilers of revised country data; hence,
the WEO estimates are only partly adapted to these
manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion
to the updated standards will have only a small impact
on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partially adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a number of years.1
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
staff estimates. While attempts are made to align gross
and net debt data with the definitions in the GFSM
2014, as a result of data limitations or specific country
circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from
the formal definitions. Although every effort is made to
ensure the WEO data are relevant and internationally
comparable, differences in both sectoral and instrument coverage mean that the data are not universally
comparable. As more information becomes available,
changes in either data sources or instrument coverage
can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes substantial. For clarification on the deviations in sectoral
or instrument coverage, please refer to the metadata for
the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.2 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years)
as a share of group GDP.
1 Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European
System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each
country adheres.
2 Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and commodity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based
on the simple arithmetic average.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.3 For the aggregation of
world and advanced economies (and subgroups) inflation, annual rates are simple percentage changes from
the previous years; for the aggregation of emerging
market and developing economies (and subgroups)
inflation, annual rates are based on logarithmic
differences.
Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasingpower-parity terms are sums of individual country data
after conversion to international dollars in the years
indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Unadjusted annual GDP
data are used for the euro area and for the majority
of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the US
dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total
world or group exports or imports (in the preceding
year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
3 See Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO for a summary of the
revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised
Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update,
Appendix 1.1 of the April 2008 WEO, Box A2 of the April 2004
WEO, Box A1 of the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May
1993 WEO. See also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne SchulzeGhattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for the World
Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic Outlook
(Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund, December 1993),
106–23.

Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data.
For some countries, the figures for 2022 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government
finance, and balance of payments for each country.

Country Notes
For Afghanistan, data and projections for 2021–28
are omitted because of an unusually high degree of
uncertainty given that the IMF has paused its engagement with the country owing to a lack of clarity
within the international community regarding the
recognition of a government in Afghanistan.
For Algeria, total government expenditure and net
lending/borrowing include net lending by the government, which mostly reflects support to the pension
system and other public sector entities.
For Argentina, the official national consumer price
index (CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos
Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013), the national
CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015), the
City of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April
2016), and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May
2016 to December 2016). Given limited comparability
of these series on account of differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology,
the WEO does not report average CPI inflation for
2014–16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015–16.
Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor
market data starting in the fourth quarter of 2015,
and new series became available starting in the second
quarter of 2016.
Data and forecasts for Bangladesh are presented
on a fiscal year basis. However, country group
aggregates that include Bangladesh use calendar
year estimates of real GDP and purchasing-powerparity GDP.
For Costa Rica, the central government definition
has been expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include
51 public entities as per Law 9524. Data back to 2019
are adjusted for comparability.
The fiscal series for the Dominican Republic have
the following coverage: Public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes the central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

117

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A ROCK Y RECOVERY

and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are
for the central government.
For Ecuador, the authorities are undertaking revisions of the historical fiscal data with technical support
from the IMF. Fiscal sector projections are excluded
from publication for 2023–28 because of ongoing
program discussions.
India’s real GDP growth rates are calculated as
per national accounts: for 1998–2011 with base year
2004/05 and, thereafter, with base year 2011/12.
For Lebanon, data and projections for 2021–28
are omitted owing to an unusually high degree of
uncertainty.
Sierra Leone redenominated its currency on July 1,
2022; however, local currency data are expressed in the
old leone for the April 2023 WEO.
For Sri Lanka, certain projections for 2023–28 are
excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring.
Data for Syria are excluded from 2011 onward
because of the uncertain political situation.
For Turkmenistan, real GDP data are IMF staff
estimates compiled in line with international methodologies (SNA), using official estimates and sources
as well as United Nations and World Bank databases.
Estimates of and projections for the fiscal balance
exclude receipts from domestic bond issuances as well
as privatization operations, in line with the GFSM
2014. The authorities’ official estimates for fiscal
accounts, which are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies, include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as part of government revenues.
For Ukraine, all projections for 2024–28 are omitted owing to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
Revised national accounts data are available beginning
in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol from
2010 onward.
In December 2020 the Uruguay authorities began
reporting the national accounts data according to the
SNA 2008, with the base year 2016. The new series
begin in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF
staff’s best effort to preserve previously reported data
and avoid structural breaks.
Since October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension
system has been receiving transfers in the context
of a new law that compensates persons affected by
the creation of the mixed pension system. These
funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the
IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018–22 are affected by these transfers,
which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018,
1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2020, and 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021 and are
projected to be 0.1 percent of GDP in 2022 and
0 percent thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64
118

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

for further details.4 The disclaimer about the public
pension system applies only to the revenues and net
lending/borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In
Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes
the central government, local government, social
security funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and
Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were
also revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal
perimeter—which excludes the central bank—assets
and liabilities held by the nonfinancial public sector
for which the counterpart is the central bank are not
netted out in debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by the government to the
central bank are now part of the nonfinancial public
sector debt. Gross and net debt estimates for 2008–11
are preliminary.
Projecting the economic outlook for Venezuela, including assessing past and current economic
developments used as the basis for the projections, is
rendered difficult by the lack of discussions with the
authorities (the most recent Article IV consultation
took place in 2004), incomplete metadata of limited reported statistics, and difficulties in reconciling
reported indicators with economic developments. The
fiscal accounts include the budgetary central government; social security; FOGADE (insurance deposit
institution); and a reduced set of public enterprises,
including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA).
Following some methodological upgrades to achieve
a more robust nominal GDP, historical data and
indicators expressed as a percentage of GDP have
been revised from 2012 onward. For most indicators,
data for 2018–22 are IMF staff estimates. The effects
of hyperinflation and the paucity of reported data
mean that the IMF staff’s projected macroeconomic
indicators should be interpreted with caution. Broad
uncertainty surrounds these projections. Venezuela’s
consumer prices are excluded from all WEO group
composites.
In 2019 Zimbabwe authorities introduced the Real
Time Gross Settlement dollar, later renamed the
Zimbabwe dollar, and are in the process of redenominating their national accounts statistics. Current data
are subject to revision. The Zimbabwe dollar previously ceased circulating in 2009, and during 2009–19
Zimbabwe operated under a multicurrency regime
with the US dollar as the unit of account.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Classification of Countries
Summary of the Country Classification
The country classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.5 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and it has evolved over time. The objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably
meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an overview of the country classification, showing
the number of countries in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba
and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are
examples of countries that are not IMF members, and
the IMF therefore does not monitor their economies.

General Features and Composition of Groups in
the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the
euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover
the current members for all years, even though the
membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (155) comprises all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies are emerging and developing Asia;
emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred
to as “central and eastern Europe”); Latin America and
5 As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always

refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

the Caribbean; Middle East and Central Asia (which
comprises the regional subgroups Caucasus and Central
Asia; and Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and
Pakistan); and sub-Saharan Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor economies.
Tables D and E show the detailed composition of
emerging market and developing economies in the
regional and analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2017 and 2021.
The financial and income criteria focus on net
creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries
(LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as
net debtors when their latest net international investment position, where available, was less than zero or
their current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest available data) to 2021 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis
of experience with debt servicing.6
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as
the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external
debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.7 Many
of these countries have already benefited from debt
relief and have graduated from the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (set at $2,700
in 2016 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be
widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs group comprises emerging market and
developing economies that are not classified as LIDCs.
6 During 2017–21, 38 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2017–21.
7 See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and
Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

1The GDP shares are based on the purchasing-power-parity valuation of economies’ GDP. The number of economies comprising each group reflects those
for which data are included in the group aggregates.
2Syria and West Bank and Gaza are omitted from the source of export earnings, and Syria is omitted from the net external position group composites
because of insufficient data. Syria is not included in Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies or Low-Income Developing Countries.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A ROCK Y RECOVERY

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions Underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions and
projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget
has been announced, projections incorporate policy
measures judged likely to be implemented. The
medium-term fiscal projections are similarly based
on a judgment about policies’ most likely path. For
cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget intentions and
prospects for policy implementation, an unchanged
structural primary balance is assumed unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions used in regard
to selected advanced and emerging market economies
follow. (See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online section of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net
lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the
available information regarding budget outturn,
budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets
for the federal government; on fiscal measures
announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff
macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fiscal year (FY)2022/23 budget published by the
Commonwealth government in October 2022,
the FY2022/23 budget and its midyear fiscal
update published by the respective state/territory
1 The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a

percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in
interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of structural balances are based on the IMF staff’s estimates of potential
GDP and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of
the October 1993 WEO.) Estimates of the output gap and of
the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets
corresponding to debt instruments.

governments, and the IMF staff’s estimates and
projections.
Austria: Fiscal projections are based on the 2023
budget and the Austria Medium Term Strategy
Programme. The NextGenerationEU (NGEU) fund
and the latest announcement on fiscal measures
have also been incorporated.
Belgium: Projections are based on the Belgian
Stability Program 2022–25, the 2023 Budgetary Plan, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2023 reflect current
policies in place.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
from the Government of Canada’s Fall Economic
Statement 2022 and the latest provincial budgets.
The IMF staff makes some adjustments to these
forecasts, including those for differences in macroeconomic projections. The IMF staff’s forecast
also incorporates the most recent data releases from
Statistics Canada’s National Economic Accounts,
including quarterly federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns.
Chile: Projections are based on the authorities’
budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff’s projections for GDP, copper prices, depreciation, and inflation.
China: Staff fiscal projections incorporate the
2023 budget as well as estimates of off-budget
financing.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are
aligned with the latest official budget numbers,
adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff’s
macroeconomic assumptions. Beyond the current
year, the projections incorporate key features of
the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ latest budget. Structural balances are
net of temporary fluctuations in some revenues
(for example, North Sea revenue, pension yield tax
revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19–related one-offs
are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2022 and projections for
2023 onward are based on the 2018–23 budget
laws, the 2023 amending social security finance bill,

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
Stability Program 2022–27, draft medium-term
programming bill, and other available information
on the authorities’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences in revenue projections and assumptions on
macroeconomic and financial variables.
Germany: The IMF staff’s projections for 2023
and beyond are based on the 2023 budgets and
data updates from the national statistical agency
(Destatis) and the ministry of finance, adjusted
for differences in the IMF staff’s macroeconomic
framework and assumptions concerning revenue
elasticities.
Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in
line with the primary balance definition under the
enhanced surveillance framework for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term
fiscal projections for expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF
staff’s projections for the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy plans announced in the 2023
budget.
India: Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year;
general government data are thus finalized well after
central government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and
license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording
of revenues in certain minor categories, and some
public sector lending. Starting with FY2020/21
data, expenditure also includes the off-budget
component of food subsidies, consistent with the
revised treatment of food subsidies in the budget.
The IMF staff adjusts expenditure to take out payments for previous years’ food subsidies, which are
included as expenditure in budget estimates for
FY2020/21.
Indonesia: The IMF staff’s projections are based
on maintaining a neutral fiscal stance, accompanied
by moderate tax policy and administration reforms,
some expenditure realization, and a gradual increase
in capital spending over the medium term in line
with fiscal space.

Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2023.
Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections
are informed by the fiscal plans included in the
government’s 2023 budget and amendments. The
stock of maturing postal bonds is included in the
debt projections.
Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the
government has already announced, with adjustments for the IMF staff’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates the overall fiscal balance in the 2022 annual budget and two
supplementary budgets, the proposed 2023 budget
and medium-term fiscal plan, and the IMF staff’s
adjustments.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing
requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for
some statistical discrepancies between above-theline and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections
for 2023 are informed by the estimates in Criterios
2023; projections for 2024 onward assume continued compliance with rules established in the Federal
Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2022–28
are based on the IMF staff’s forecast framework and
are also informed by the authorities’ draft budget
plan and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
projections.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
FY2022/23 budget (May 2022) and the IMF staff’s
estimates.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption
of unchanged policies. Projections for 2023 reflect
information available in the 2023 budget proposal.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by
the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, which was prepared in January 2022,
certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board.
Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended last year
by the government in response to the sanctions
imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, allowing for

windfall oil and gas revenues above benchmark to
be used to finance a larger deficit in 2022. Savings
accumulated in the National Welfare Fund can
also now be used this way. A new fiscal rule will
become fully effective in 2025. The new rule allows
for higher oil and gas revenues to be spent, but it
simultaneously targets a smaller primary structural
deficit.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal
projections are based primarily on its understanding of government policies as outlined in the 2022
budget. Export oil revenues are based on WEO
baseline oil price assumptions and the IMF staff’s
understanding of current oil policy under the
OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC
oil exporters) agreement.
Singapore: FY2020 figures are based on budget
execution. FY2021 projections are based on revised
figures based on budget execution through the
end of 2021. FY2022 projections are based on the
initial budget of February 18, 2022. The IMF staff
assumes gradual withdrawal of remaining pandemicrelated measures and the implementation of various
revenue measures announced in the FY2022 budget
for the remainder of the projection period. These
include (1) an increase in the Goods and Services
Tax from 7 percent to 8 percent on January 1,
2023, and to 9 percent on January 1, 2024; (2) an
increase in property taxes in 2023 for non-owneroccupied properties (from 10–20 percent to
12–36 percent) and for owner-occupied properties
with an annual value in excess of S$30,000 (from
4–16 percent to 6–32 percent); and (3) an increase
of the carbon tax from S$5 a tonne to S$25 a tonne
in 2024 and 2025 and S$45 a tonne in 2026 and
2027.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions draw on the
2022 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.
Nontax revenue excludes transactions in financial assets and liabilities, as they involve primarily
revenues associated with realized exchange rate valuation gains from the holding of foreign currency
deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually similar
items.

138

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

Spain: Fiscal projections for 2022 include
COVID-19– and energy-related support measures,
a legislated increase in pensions, and legislated revenue measures. Fiscal projections from 2023 onward
assume energy support measures amounting to 1
percent of GDP in 2023. Projections for 2021–25
reflect disbursements under the EU Recovery and
Resilience Facility.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates for 2022 and 2023 are
based on the authorities’ Budget Bill and have been
updated with the authorities’ latest interim forecast.
The impact of cyclical developments on the fiscal
accounts is calculated using the 2014 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
elasticity2 to take into account output and employment gaps.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s
fiscal rules.
Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the
IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some
revenue and expenditure items that are included in
the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based
on the latest GDP data published by the Office of
National Statistics on January 21, 2023, and forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility from
March 15, 2023. Revenue projections are adjusted
for differences between the IMF staff’s forecasts for
macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth
and inflation) and the forecasts for these variables
assumed in the authorities’ fiscal projections.
IMF baseline projections take Office for Budget
Responsibility forecasts only as a reference and do
not necessarily assume that the new fiscal rules
announced on November 17, 2022, will be met at
the end of the forecast period. The IMF staff’s data
exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to

the public sector in April 2012. Real government
consumption and investment are part of the real
GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may
or may not be the same as projected by the Office
for Budget Responsibility. Data are presented on a
calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on
the February 2023 Congressional Budget Office
baseline, adjusted for the IMF staff’s policy and
macroeconomic assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
and Inflation Reduction Act. Fiscal projections are
adjusted to reflect the IMF staff’s forecasts for key
macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support
and of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each country.
In most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative
stance over the business cycle: Official interest rates
will increase when economic indicators suggest
that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or
range; they will decrease when indicators suggest
that inflation will not exceed the acceptable rate
or range, that output growth is below its potential
rate, and that the margin of slack in the economy is
significant. With regard to interest rates, please refer
to the “Assumptions” section at the beginning of
the Statistical Appendix.
Argentina: Monetary projections are consistent
with the overall macroeconomic framework, the
fiscal and financing plans, and the monetary and
foreign exchange policies under the crawling-peg
regime.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are based
on the IMF staff’s analysis and the expected inflation path.
Austria: Monetary growth projections are in
proportion to nominal GDP growth.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with the convergence of inflation within the
tolerance band by the end of 2024.

Canada: Projections reflect monetary policy
tightening by the Bank of Canada and increased
long-term yields, in response to inflation significantly overshooting its target. It is expected that the
Bank of Canada will keep the rates high for most of
2023 to bring down inflation back to its target by
the end of 2024.
Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target.
China: The overall monetary policy stance
was moderately accommodative in 2022 and is
expected to remain broadly accommodative in
2023.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg
to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are drawn from a suite of
models (semistructural, dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium [DSGE], Taylor rule), market expectations, and the European Central Bank Governing
Council communication.
Greece: Broad money projections are based on
monetary financial institution balance sheets and
deposit flow assumptions.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The
IMF staff assumes that the currency board system
will remain intact.
Hungary: The IMF staff’s judgment is based on
recent developments.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term, despite a recent uptick
in inflation that exceeded the upper target band.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in
line with inflation within the central bank’s target
band over the medium term.
Israel: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
gradual normalization of monetary policy.
Italy: The IMF staff’s estimates and projections
are informed by the actual outturn from and
policy plans by the Bank of Italy and the European
Central Bank’s monetary policy stance forecast from
the IMF’s euro area team.
Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

Korea: Projections assume that the policy rate will
evolve in line with market expectations.
Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target.
The Netherlands: Monetary projections are based
on the IMF staff’s estimated six-month euro London
interbank offered rate projections.
New Zealand: Monetary projections are based on
the IMF staff’s analysis and expected inflation path.
Portugal: Monetary policy assumptions are based
on the IMF staff’s spreadsheets, given input projections for the real and fiscal sectors.
Russia: Monetary policy projections assume
that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is
adopting a tight monetary policy stance.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are
based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg
to the US dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in
line with the projected growth in nominal GDP.

140

International Monetary Fund | April 2023

South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are
consistent with maintaining inflation within the
3–6 percent target band over the medium term.
Spain: Monetary growth projections are in proportion to nominal GDP growth.
Sweden: Monetary projections are in line with
Riksbank projections.
Switzerland: The inflation outlook suggests that
the Swiss National Bank may need to continue
monetary tightening in 2023.
Türkiye: The baseline assumes that the monetary policy stance will remain in line with market
expectations.
United Kingdom: The short-term interest rate path is based on market interest rate
expectations.
United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal
Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the
federal funds target rate in line with the broader
macroeconomic outlook.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted by
GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’
national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of
payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to
the current account balance (CAB) (S − I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
MARCH 2023

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on March 30, 2023.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with staff’s
assessment of the global economic outlook,
risks, and policy priorities. They considered
that the persistence of high inflation in many
countries and recent financial sector stresses increase
the challenges to global economic prospects and leave
policymakers with a narrow path to restore price
stability, while avoiding a recession and maintaining
broad financial stability. In addition, Directors generally concurred that many of the forces that shaped
the world economy in 2022—including Russia’s
war in Ukraine and geopolitical tensions, high debt
levels constraining fiscal responses, and tighter global
financial ­conditions—appear likely to continue into
this year. In this context, they expressed concern that
the medium-term growth projections for the global
economy remain the lowest in decades.
Directors agreed that risks to the outlook have
increased and are tilted to the downside. They noted
that core inflation could turn out more persistent than
anticipated, which would call for even tighter monetary policies. They also emphasized that recent stresses
in the banking sector could amplify with contagion
effects, pockets of sovereign debt distress could become
more widespread as a result of wider exchange rate
movements and higher borrowing costs, and the war in
Ukraine and geopolitical conflicts could intensify and
lead to more food and energy price spikes as well as
further geoeconomic fragmentation.
Directors reiterated their strong call for multilateral cooperation to help defuse geopolitical tensions
and respond to the challenges of an interconnected
world. They emphasized the criticality of multilateral
actions to safeguard the functioning of global financial markets, manage debt distress, foster global trade
and reinforce the multilateral trading system, ensure
food and energy security, advance with the green and
digital transitions, and improve resilience to future

­pandemics. Most Directors also agreed that fragmentation into geopolitical blocs could generate large
output losses, including through effects on foreign
direct investment, and especially affecting emerging
market and developing economies; a few Directors
emphasized the need to build resilience and diversification in supply chains. Noting that many countries
are contending with tighter financial conditions, high
debt levels, and pressures to protect the most vulnerable segments from high inflation, Directors stressed
the need for multilateral institutions to stand ready to
provide timely support to safeguard essential spending
and ensure that any crises remain contained. They also
stressed the importance of improving debt transparency and of better mechanisms to produce orderly debt
­restructurings—including a more effective Common
Framework—in cases where insolvency issues prevail.
In this context, Directors encouraged the newly established Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable to become
an effective venue for solving coordination impediments in debt restructuring operations.
Directors agreed that policy responses—monetary,
fiscal, and financial—differ across countries, reflecting
their own circumstances and exposures. For most economies, they generally considered that policy tightening
is necessary to durably reduce inflation, while standing
ready to take appropriate actions to mitigate financial
sector risks as needed. Directors also emphasized that
structural reforms remain essential to improve productivity, expand economic capacity, and ease supply-side
constraints. They acknowledged that many emerging
market and developing economies face tougher policy
choices, as rising costs of market financing, higher food
and fuel prices, and the need to support the recovery
and vulnerable populations can pull in different directions, necessitating a difficult balancing act.
Directors agreed that central banks should maintain a sufficiently tight, data-dependent monetary

policy stance to durably reduce inflation and avoid a
de-anchoring of inflation expectations. At the same
time, they called on policymakers to stand ready to
take strong actions to restore financial stability and
reinvigorate confidence as developments demand. With
respect to the future path of monetary policy, Directors stressed that clear communication about policy
reaction functions and objectives and the need to further normalize policy would help avoid unwarranted
market volatility.
Directors stressed that fiscal and monetary policies
need to be closely aligned to help deliver price and
financial stability. They emphasized that tighter fiscal
policy is needed to help contain inflationary pressures,
making it possible for central banks to increase interest
rates by less than otherwise, help contain governments’ borrowing costs, and ease potential tradeoffs
between price and financial stability. At the same time,
Directors agreed that fiscal restraint should be accompanied by temporary and carefully targeted measures
to protect the most vulnerable segments. Given the
heightened uncertainty, they generally concurred that
fiscal policy should remain flexible to respond if risks
materialized. To tackle the elevated debt vulnerabilities
and rebuild fiscal buffers to cope with future crises,
Directors called for credible medium-term fiscal frameworks, while also cautioning against relying on high
inflation for public debt reduction. In low-income
developing countries, they stressed the need for further

efforts to increase tax capacity, given the importance of
addressing heightened debt vulnerabilities, protecting
the poorest, and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Directors commended the decisive responses by
policymakers to stem recent financial instability. They
noted that the recent stress in the banking sector
has highlighted failures in internal risk-management
practices with respect to interest rate and liquidity risks
in some banks, as well as supervisory lapses. Against
this backdrop, Directors stressed the importance of
closely monitoring financial sector developments,
including in nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs);
improving banking regulation, supervision, and resolution frameworks; and a swift and appropriate use of
available policies, including macroprudential policies,
if further vulnerabilities materialize, while mitigating
moral hazard. Directors noted that NBFIs play an
important role in financial markets and are increasingly interconnected with banks and other financial
institutions. In this context, many Directors considered
that the provision of central bank liquidity to NBFIs
could lead to unintended consequences. In the event
that liquidity provision to NBFIs should be needed
to address systemic risks threatening the health of the
financial system, Directors emphasized that appropriate
guardrails, including robust regulation and supervision,
should be in place and that progress in closing regulatory data gaps in this sector remains vital.
