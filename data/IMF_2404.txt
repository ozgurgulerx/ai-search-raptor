ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during January 30, 2024–February 27, 2024, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate
mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $78.61
a barrel in 2024 and $73.68 a barrel in 2025; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 5.2 percent in 2024 and 4.1 percent in 2025, that for the euro area will average 3.5 percent in 2024
and 2.6 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will average 0.0 percent in 2024 and 0.1 percent in 2025; and that
the 10-year government bond yield for the United States will average 4.1 percent in 2024 and 3.7 percent in 2025,
that for the euro area will average 2.5 percent in 2024 and 2.6 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will average
1.0 percent in 2024 and 1.1 percent in 2025. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts,
and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the
projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through April 1, 2024.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
• ...

to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;

• – between years or months (for example, 2023–24 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
• /

between years or months (for example, 2023/24) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

• “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
• “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
• Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data for each country.
• For some countries, the figures for 2023 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the
national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Ecuador’s fiscal sector projections are excluded from publication for 2024–29 because of ongoing program
discussions.
• Vietnam has been removed from the Low-Income Developing Countries (LIDCs) group and added to the
Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies (EMMIEs) group.
• For West Bank and Gaza, data for 2022–23 previously excluded from publication pending methodological adjustments to statistical series are now included. Projections for 2024–29 are excluded from publication on account of
the unusually high degree of uncertainty.

Assumptions and Conventions

In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• Tables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw
on data from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
• Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
• The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of
the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

DATA

This version of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is available in full through the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.
imf.org) and the IMF website (www.imf.org). Accompanying the publication on the IMF website is a larger compilation of data from the WEO database than is included in the report itself, including files containing the series
most frequently requested by readers. These files may be downloaded for use in a variety of software packages.
The data appearing in the WEO are compiled by the IMF staff at the time of the WEO exercises. The historical data and projections are based on the information gathered by the IMF country desk officers in the context
of their missions to IMF member countries and through their ongoing analysis of the evolving situation in each
country. Historical data are updated on a continual basis as more information becomes available, and structural
breaks in data are often adjusted to produce smooth series with the use of splicing and other techniques. IMF
staff estimates continue to serve as proxies for historical series when complete information is unavailable. As a
result, WEO data can differ from those in other sources with official data, including the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics.
The WEO data and metadata provided are “as is” and “as available,” and every effort is made to ensure their
timeliness, accuracy, and completeness, but these cannot be guaranteed. When errors are discovered, there is a
concerted effort to correct them as appropriate and feasible. Corrections and revisions made after publication are
incorporated into the electronic editions available from the IMF eLibrary (www.elibrary.imf.org) and on the IMF
website (www.imf.org). All substantive changes are listed in detail in the online tables of contents.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya
Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, Research Department.
Aqib Aslam, Division Chief, Research Department and Head of the Spillovers Task Force, supervised Chapter 4.

The analysis has benefited from comments and suggestions by staff members from other IMF departments,
as well as by Executive Directors following their discussion of the report on April 3, 2024. However, estimates,
projections, and policy considerations are those of the IMF staff and should not be attributed to Executive
Directors or to their national authorities.

FOREWORD

Global Economy Remains Resilient despite
Uneven Growth; Challenges Lie Ahead
The global economy remains remarkably resilient, with growth holding steady as inflation returns
to target. The journey has been eventful, starting
with supply-chain disruptions in the aftermath of
the pandemic, a Russian-initiated war on Ukraine
that triggered a global energy and food crisis, and a
considerable surge in inflation, followed by a globally
synchronized monetary policy tightening.
Yet, despite many gloomy predictions, the world
avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely
resilient, and major emerging market economies
did not suffer sudden stops. Moreover, the inflation
surge—despite its severity and the associated cost-ofliving crisis—did not trigger uncontrolled wage-price
spirals (see October 2022 World Economic Outlook).
Instead, almost as quickly as global inflation went up,
it has been coming down.
On a year-over-year basis, global growth bottomed
out at the end of 2022, at 2.3 percent, shortly after
median headline inflation peaked at 9.4 percent.
According to our latest projections, growth for 2024
and 2025 will hold steady around 3.2 percent, with
median headline inflation declining from 2.8 percent
at the end of 2024 to 2.4 percent at the end of 2025.
Most indicators point to a soft landing.
Markets reacted exuberantly to the prospect of central banks exiting from tight monetary policy. Financial
conditions eased, equity valuations soared, capital flows
to most emerging market economies excluding China
have been buoyant, and some low-income countries
and frontier economies regained market access (see the
April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report).
Even more encouraging, we now estimate that
there will be less economic scarring from the
pandemic—the projected drop in output relative
to prepandemic projections—for most countries
and regions, especially for emerging market economies, thanks in part to robust employment growth.
Astonishingly, the US economy has already surged
past its prepandemic trend.

Resilient growth and faster disinflation point
toward favorable supply developments, including
the fading of earlier energy price shocks, the striking
rebound in labor supply supported by strong immigration flows in many advanced economies. Decisive
monetary policy actions, as well as improved monetary policy frameworks, especially in emerging market
economies, have helped anchor inflation expectations. As Chapter 2 of this report argues, however,
the transmission of monetary policy may have been
more muted this time around in countries such as the
United States, where an increased share of fixed-rate
mortgages and lower household debt levels since the
global financial crisis may have limited the drag on
aggregate demand up to now.
Despite these welcome developments, numerous
challenges remain, and decisive actions are needed.
First, while inflation trends are encouraging, we
are not there yet. Somewhat worryingly, the most
recent median headline and core inflation numbers are
pushing upward. This could be temporary, but there
are reasons to remain vigilant. Most of the progress on
inflation came from the decline in energy prices and
goods inflation below its historical average. The latter
has been helped by easing supply-chain frictions, as
well as by the decline in Chinese export prices. But
services inflation remains high—sometimes stubbornly
so—and could derail the disinflation path. Bringing
inflation down to target remains the priority.
Second, the global view can mask stark divergence
across countries. The exceptional recent performance
of the United States is certainly impressive and a major
driver of global growth, but it reflects strong demand
factors as well, including a fiscal stance that is out of
line with long-term fiscal sustainability (see April 2024
Fiscal Monitor). This raises short-term risks to the
disinflation process, as well as longer-term fiscal and
financial stability risks for the global economy since it
risks pushing up global funding costs. Something will
have to give.
In the euro area, growth will pick up this year, but
from very low levels, as the trailing effects of tight

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

monetary policy and past energy costs, as well as
planned fiscal consolidation, weigh on activity. Continued high wage growth and persistent services inflation
could delay the return of inflation to target. However,
unlike in the United States, there is scant evidence of
overheating and the European Central Bank will also
need to carefully calibrate the pivot toward monetary
easing to avoid an excessive growth slowdown and
inflation undershoot. While labor markets appear
strong, that strength could prove illusory if European
firms have been hoarding labor in anticipation of a
pickup in activity that does not materialize.
China’s economy is affected by the enduring downturn in its property sector. Credit booms and busts
never resolve themselves quickly, and this one is no
exception. Domestic demand will remain lackluster
for some time unless strong measures and reforms
address the root cause. Public debt dynamics are also
of concern, especially if the property crisis morphs into
a local public finance crisis. With depressed domestic
demand, external surpluses could rise. The risk is that
this will further exacerbate trade tensions in an already
fraught geopolitical environment.
At the same time, many other large emerging
market economies are performing strongly, sometimes
even benefiting from a reconfiguration of global supply
chains and rising trade tensions between China and the
United States. As Chapter 4 of this report documents,
these countries’ footprint on the global economy is
increasing, and they will play an ever larger role in
supporting global growth in years to come.
A troubling development is the widening divergence
between many low-income developing countries and
the rest of the world. For these economies, growth
is revised downward, whereas inflation is revised up.
Worse, in contrast with most other regions, scarring
estimates for low-income developing countries, including some large ones, have been revised up, suggesting
that the poorest countries are still unable to turn the
page from the pandemic and cost-of-living crises. In
addition, conflicts continue to result in loss of human
lives and raise uncertainty. For these countries, investing in structural reforms to promote growth-enhancing
domestic and foreign direct investment, and strengthening domestic resource mobilization, can help
manage borrowing costs and reduce funding needs
while achieving development goals. Efforts must also
be made to improve the human capital of their large
young populations.

xiv

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

Third, even as inflation recedes, real interest rates
have increased, and sovereign debt dynamics have
become less favorable in particular for highly indebted
emerging markets. Countries should turn their sights
toward rebuilding fiscal buffers. Credible fiscal consolidations help lower funding costs and improve financial
stability. In a world with more frequent adverse supply
shocks and growing fiscal needs for safety nets, climate
adaptation, digital transformation, energy security,
and defense, this should be a policy priority. Yet this is
never easy, as the April 2023 World Economic Outlook
documented: fiscal consolidations are more likely to
succeed when credible and when implemented while
the economy is growing, rather than when markets
dictate their conditions. In countries where inflation is
under control, and that engage in a credible multiyear
effort to rebuild fiscal buffers, monetary policy can
help support activity. The successful 1993 US fiscal
consolidation and monetary accommodation episode
comes to mind as an example to emulate.
Fourth, medium-term growth prospects remain
historically weak. Chapter 3 of this report takes an
in-depth dive into the different drivers of the slowdown. The main culprit is lower total factor productivity growth. A significant part of the decline
comes from increased misallocation of capital and
labor within sectors and countries. Facilitating faster
and more efficient resource allocation can help boost
growth. Much hope rests on artificial intelligence (AI)
delivering strong productivity gains in the medium
term. It may do so, but the potential for serious
disruptions in labor and financial markets is high.
Harnessing the potential of AI for all will require that
countries improve their digital infrastructure, invest
in human capital, and coordinate on global rules of
the road. Medium-term growth prospects are also
harmed by rising geoeconomic fragmentation and the
surge in trade restrictive and industrial policy measures since 2019. Global trade linkages are already
changing as a result, with potential losses in efficiency.
But the broader damage is to global cooperation and
multilateralism.
Finally, huge global investments are needed for a
green and climate-resilient future. Cutting emissions
is compatible with growth, as is seen in recent decades
during which growth has become much less emissions intensive. Nevertheless, emissions are still rising.
A lot more needs to be done and done quickly. Green
investment has expanded at a healthy pace in advanced

FOREWORD

economies and China. Cutting harmful fossil fuel
subsidies can help create the necessary fiscal room for
further green investments. The greatest effort must be
made by other emerging market and developing economies, which need to massively increase their green
investment growth and reduce their fossil fuel investment. This will require technology transfer by other
advanced economies and China, as well as substantial

financing, much of it from the private sector, but some
of it concessional.
On these questions, as well as on so many others,
there is little hope for progress outside multilateral
frameworks and cooperation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Economic activity was surprisingly resilient through
the global disinflation of 2022–23. As global inflation
descended from its mid-2022 peak, economic activity
grew steadily, defying warnings of stagflation and global
recession. Growth in employment and incomes held
steady, reflecting supportive demand developments––
including greater-than-expected government spending
and household consumption—and a supply-side expansion amid, notably, an unanticipated boost to labor
force participation. The unexpected economic resilience,
despite significant central bank interest rate hikes aimed
at restoring price stability, also reflects the ability of
households in major advanced economies to draw on
substantial savings accumulated during the pandemic.
In addition, as Chapter 2 explains, changes in mortgage
and housing markets over the prepandemic decade of
low interest rates moderated the near-term impact of
policy rate hikes. As inflation converges toward target
levels and central banks pivot toward policy easing in
many economies, a tightening of fiscal policies aimed at
curbing high government debt, with higher taxes and
lower government spending, is expected to weigh on
growth.
Global growth, estimated at 3.2 percent in 2023,
is projected to continue at the same pace in 2024 and
2025. The forecast for 2024 is revised up by 0.1 percentage point from the January 2024 World Economic
Outlook (WEO) Update, and by 0.3 percentage point
from the October 2023 WEO. The pace of expansion
is low by historical standards, owing to both near-term
factors, such as still-high borrowing costs and withdrawal of fiscal support, and longer-term effects from
the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine; weak growth in productivity; and increasing
geoeconomic fragmentation. Global headline inflation
is expected to fall from an annual average of 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent
in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their
inflation targets sooner than emerging market and
developing economies. The latest forecast for global
growth five years from now––at 3.1 percent––is at its
lowest in decades. The pace of convergence toward
higher living standards for middle- and lower-income

xvi

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

countries has slowed, implying a persistence in global
economic disparities. As Chapter 3 explains, the
relatively weak medium-term outlook reflects lower
growth in GDP per person stemming, notably, from
persistent structural frictions preventing capital and
labor from moving to productive firms. Chapter 4
indicates how dimmer prospects for growth in China
and other large emerging market economies, given
their increasing share of the global economy, will weigh
on the prospects of trading partners.
Risks to the global outlook are now broadly balanced. On the downside, new price spikes stemming
from geopolitical tensions, including those from the
war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza and Israel,
could, along with persistent core inflation where labor
markets are still tight, raise interest rate expectations
and reduce asset prices. A divergence in disinflation
speeds among major economies could also cause
currency movements that put financial sectors under
pressure. High interest rates could have greater cooling
effects than envisaged as fixed-rate mortgages reset and
households contend with high debt, causing financial
stress. In China, without a comprehensive response
to the troubled property sector, growth could falter,
hurting trading partners. Amid high government debt
in many economies, a disruptive turn to tax hikes and
spending cuts could weaken activity, erode confidence,
and sap support for reform and spending to reduce
risks from climate change. Geoeconomic fragmentation could intensify, with higher barriers to the flow
of goods, capital, and people implying a supply-side
slowdown. On the upside, looser fiscal policy than necessary and assumed in projections could raise economic
activity in the short term, although risking more costly
policy adjustment later on. Inflation could fall faster
than expected amid further gains in labor force participation, allowing central banks to bring easing plans
forward. Artificial intelligence and stronger structural
reforms than anticipated could spur productivity.
As the global economy approaches a soft landing,
the near-term priority for central banks is to ensure
that inflation touches down smoothly, by neither
easing policies prematurely nor delaying too long

Executive Summary

and causing target undershoots. At the same time, as
central banks take a less restrictive stance, a renewed
focus on implementing medium-term fiscal consolidation to rebuild room for budgetary maneuver and
priority investments, and to ensure debt sustainability,
is in order. Cross-country differences call for tailored
policy responses. Intensifying supply-enhancing

reforms would facilitate inflation and debt reduction,
allow economies to increase growth toward the higher
prepandemic era average, and accelerate convergence
toward higher income levels. Multilateral cooperation
is needed to limit the costs and risks of geoeconomic
fragmentation and climate change, speed the transition
to green energy, and facilitate debt restructuring.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Disinflation amid Economic Resilience
Economic activity was surprisingly resilient during
the global disinflation of 2022–23. Growth in employment and incomes has held steady as favorable demand
and supply developments have supported major
economies, despite rising central bank interest rates
aimed at restoring price stability. As inflation converges
toward target levels and central banks pivot toward
policy easing, a tightening of fiscal policies aimed at
curbing high government debt levels, with higher taxes
and lower government spending, is expected to weigh
on growth. The pace of expansion is also expected
to remain low by historical standards as a result of
factors including the long-term consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
weak growth in productivity, and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation.
In late 2023, headline inflation neared its
prepandemic level in most economies for the first
time since the start of the global inflation surge
(Figure 1.1). In the last quarter of 2023, headline
inflation for advanced economies was 2.3 percent on
a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis, down from a
peak of 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2022. For
emerging market and developing economies, inflation
was 9.9 percent in the last quarter of 2023, down from
a peak of 13.7 percent in the first quarter of 2022,
but this average was driven by high inflation in a few
countries; for the median emerging market and developing economy, inflation declined to 3.9 percent. This
progress notwithstanding, inflation is not yet at target
in most economies.
As global inflation descended from its peak,
economic activity grew steadily, defying warnings
of stagflation and global recession. During 2022
and 2023, global real GDP rose by a cumulative
6.7 percent. That is 0.8 percentage point higher
than the forecasts made at the time of the October
2022 World Economic Outlook (WEO) (Figure 1.2).
The United States and several large emerging market
and middle-income economies displayed the greatest
overperformance, with aggregate demand supported
by stronger-than-expected private consumption amid

still-tight––though easing––labor markets. Households
in advanced economies supported their spending by
drawing down accumulated pandemic-era savings.
Larger-than-expected government spending further
supported the expansion of aggregate demand in most
regions. The overall budgetary stance––measured by
the structural fiscal balance––was more expansionary
than expected, on average. Among large economies,
the additional budgetary support, compared with
October 2022 WEO forecasts, was estimated at 2 percent of GDP in the United States and 0.2 percent of
GDP in the euro area, whereas in China,1 the fiscal
stance was mildly tighter than expected, by 0.7 percent of GDP. The euro area also displayed the smallest
upside growth surprise, reflecting weak consumer sentiment and the lingering effects of high energy prices.
In parallel, global headline inflation declined broadly
in line with expectations, averaging just 0.1 percentage
point more than predicted in the October 2022 WEO
for 2022 and 2023. However, in lower-income countries, inflation was on average higher than expected,
reflecting cases in which pass-through into domestic
prices from international food, fuel, and fertilizer costs,
as well as from currency depreciation, was greater
than expected. Price pressures in some lower-income
countries were significant. These factors also caused
these economies to grow more slowly than expected,
suggesting a negative supply shock. In China, inflation
fell unexpectedly, with the decrease reflecting sharply
lower domestic food prices and pass-through effects on
underlying (core) inflation.
The resilience in global economic activity was compatible with falling inflation thanks to a postpandemic
expansion on the supply side. A greater-than-expected
rise in the labor force amid robust employment
growth supported activity and disinflation in advanced
economies and several large emerging market and
middle-income economies. The labor force expansion
reflected, in some economies, increased inflows of
1China’s deficit and public debt numbers cover a narrower
perimeter of the general government than the IMF staff ’s estimates
in China Article IV reports (see IMF 2024 for a reconciliation of the
two estimates).

migrants, with faster growth in the foreign-born than in
the domestic-born labor force since 2021 (Figure 1.3),
as well as higher labor force participation rates. Exceptions to this pattern include China, where labor market
weakness, in the context of subdued demand, was
broad based across sectors, and lower-income countries,
where supply-side challenges held job creation back.
Greater-than-expected additions to the stock of physical capital, with business investment responding to
the strength in product demand, further bolstered the
supply side in most regions, with exceptions including
the euro area, where interest-rate-sensitive business
investment, particularly in manufacturing, was subdued.
A resolution of pandemic-era supply-chain problems
allowed delivery times to decline and transportation
costs to decrease (Figure 1.4). After attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea––through which 11 percent of global trade flows––global transportation costs
increased, reflecting the rerouting of cargo from the Suez
Canal to the Cape of Good Hope and continued trade
disruptions from climate extremes in the Panama Canal,

but remained well below their 2021–22 levels and have
recently declined. The price of energy fell faster than
expected from its peak (Figure 1.5), in part as a result
of increased non-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries) oil production and increased natural gas output, most notably in the United States. Rising
exports of Russian oil on account of the expanding
non-Western-aligned oil tanker fleet carrying Russian
oil and Russia’s setting up its own maritime insurance
added further to the world energy supply.

Inflation (and Expectations) in Decline
The fall in headline inflation since 2022 reflects
the fading of relative price shocks––notably those to
energy prices—as well as lower core inflation. The
decline in energy prices reflects not only increased
global energy supply, but also the effects of tight
monetary policies. The monetary tightening by central
banks in major advanced economies during 2022–23
may have contributed strongly to lowering energy
prices owing to its high degree of synchronization and

the associated effect on curbing world energy demand
(as in the analysis of Auclert and others 2023).
Core inflation has declined as a result of the fading
of effects of pass-through from past shocks to headline
inflation, as well as because labor market pressures
have eased. Pass-through effects include the effects of
past relative price shocks—notably those to the price
of energy and supply shifts in various industries—
on prices and costs in other industries through
supply-chain inputs and wage demands. Near-term
inflation expectations are an important pass-through
channel because of their implications for both wage
and price setting (see Chapter 2 of the October 2023
WEO) and have declined toward target levels in
both advanced economies and emerging market and
developing economies (Figure 1.6), although measures of financial-market-based inflation expectations
have recently shown signs of a pickup in the US.
Longer-term inflation expectations have remained
anchored, despite the string of large shocks since
2020––with decisive communication and action by

central banks safeguarding the credibility of their inflation targets––and contributed little to recent movements
in core inflation. Labor markets remain tight, especially
in the United States, but the recent decline in the ratio
of vacancies to the number of unemployed people amid
a rise in unemployment rates suggests an easing across
several economies (Figure 1.7). Nominal wage growth
has generally remained contained in advanced economies since 2022, especially in the euro area, implying
a moderation in real (inflation-adjusted) wages. Real
wages are now close to or slightly below the level they
were on before the pandemic in these economies.
Wage-price spirals—in which prices and wages accelerate together for a sustained period—have generally not
taken hold. Nevertheless, wages at the bottom of the
wage distribution have risen faster than the average since
the start of the pandemic, compressing the distribution.
The roles of these factors in reducing core inflation have diverged across major economies. IMF staff
analysis (Figure 1.8) suggests that the rapid fading of
pass-through from past relative price movements––in
particular from energy price shocks––has played a larger
role in the euro area and the United Kingdom than
in the United States in reducing core inflation (the
staff ’s methodology was the same as that used in Dao
and others 2023). In the United States, labor market
tightness and, more broadly, strong macroeconomic

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Interest Rates Restrictive, but Set to Fall
To counter rising inflation, major central banks have
raised policy interest rates to levels estimated as restrictive. As a result, mortgage costs have increased and
credit availability is generally tight, resulting in difficulties for firms refinancing their debt, rising corporate
bankruptcies, and subdued business and residential
investment in several economies. The commercial real
estate sector, including office markets, is under especially strong pressure in some economies, with rising
defaults and lower investment and valuations, reflecting the combined effects of higher borrowing costs and
the shift toward remote work since the pandemic (see
the April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report).
However, despite concerns, a global economic
downturn caused by a sharp rise in policy rates has not
materialized, for several reasons. First, some central
banks—including the European Central Bank and the
Federal Reserve—raised their nominal interest rates
after inflation expectations started to rise, resulting in
lower real rates that initially supported economic activity (Figure 1.9). The Bank of Japan has continued to
keep policy rates near zero, resulting in a steady decline
in real interest rates. By contrast, the central banks of
Brazil, Chile, and several other emerging market and
developing economies raised rates relatively quickly,
resulting in earlier increases in real interest rates.
Second, households in major advanced economies were
able to draw on substantial savings accumulated during
the pandemic to limit the impact of higher borrowing costs on their spending (Figure 1.10).2 Third, as
Chapter 2 explains, changes in mortgage and housing
markets over the prepandemic decade of low interest
rates have limited the drag of the recent rise in policy
rates on household consumption in several economies.
The average maturity and share of mortgages subject to
fixed rates increased, moderating the near-term impact
of rate hikes. At the same time, there is substantial
heterogeneity in the degree of the monetary policy
pass-through to mortgages and housing markets across
countries.
Nevertheless, the cooling effects of high policy
rates are intensifying in several economies. Fixed-rate
mortgages are resetting, the stock of pandemic savings
2Estimates of the stock of excess household savings—the accumulation of savings beyond the prepandemic trend—come with a range
of uncertainty but generally show a consistent pattern across methodological approaches, with the stock declining in major advanced
economies since 2022. Estimates based on a linear trend show a less
pronounced drop in excess household savings for some economies.

available to soften the impact on households has
declined in advanced economies, and with inflation
expectations falling, real policy rates are rising even
where central banks have not changed nominal rates.
At the same time, with inflation moving toward
targets, market expectations that policy rates will
decline have generally contributed to a decline in
long-term borrowing rates, rising equity markets, and
an easing in overall global financial conditions since
last October, although funding is still more expensive than before the pandemic (see the April 2024
Global Financial Stability Report). Central banks that
raised policy rates earlier, including those in Brazil
and Chile, have already cut them substantially since

the second half of 2023. With expectations of lower
interest rates in advanced economies, the appetite for
assets in emerging market and developing economies
has picked up, and sovereign spreads on risk-free
government debt have fallen from their July 2022
peaks toward their prepandemic levels (Figure 1.11).
Accordingly, more governments that earlier faced
severe funding shortages are accessing international
debt markets this year.

Elevated Debt Burdens
Debt-to-GDP ratios, which increased sharply
during the pandemic, remain elevated, and large
budget deficits continue to raise the debt burden in
many economies (see the April 2024 Fiscal Monitor).
Interest payments on debt have also increased as a
share of government revenues (Figure 1.12), crowding
out necessary growth-enhancing budgetary investments. In low-income countries, interest payments
are estimated to average 14.3 percent of general
government revenues in 2024, about double the level
15 years ago. To rebuild budgetary room for maneuver and curb the rising path of debt, the fiscal policy
stance is expected to tighten in 2024 and beyond,
with higher taxes and lower government spending in
several advanced and emerging market and developing economies. This shift is expected to weigh on
near-term economic activity.

The Outlook: Steady Growth and Disinflation
Latest projections are for the global economy to
continue growing at a similar pace as in 2023 during
2024–25 and for global headline and core inflation
to decline steadily. There is little change in the forecast for global growth since the January 2024 WEO
Update, with some adjustments for major economies
(Tables 1.1 and 1.2), including a further strengthening
in the projection for the United States, offset by modest
downward revisions across several other economies. The
forecast for global growth remains higher, however, than
in the October 2023 WEO. The outlook for inflation is
broadly similar to that in the October 2023 WEO, with
a downward revision for advanced economies, offset by
an upward revision for emerging market and developing
economies. Medium-term prospects for growth in world
output and trade remain the lowest in decades, with
the pace of convergence toward higher living standards
slowing for middle- and lower-income countries.
The baseline forecasts for the global economy are
predicated on a number of projections for global
commodity prices, interest rates, and fiscal policies
(Figure 1.13):

Commodity Special Feature in this chapter, prices
of fuel commodities are projected to fall in 2024

by, on average, 9.7 percent, with oil prices falling by about 2.5 percent. The decreases reflect
abundant spare capacity and strong non-OPEC+
(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected nonmember countries, including
Russia) supply growth. Coal and natural gas prices
are expected to continue declining from their earlier peaks, by 25.1 percent for coal and 32.6 percent for natural gas in 2024, with the gas market
becoming increasingly balanced on account of

new supply, dampened demand, and high storage
levels. The forecast for nonfuel commodity prices
is broadly stable in 2024, with prices for base
metals expected to fall by 1.8 percent, on account
of weaker industrial activity in Europe and China.
Food commodity prices are predicted to decline
by 2.2 percent in 2024. Compared with those in
the January 2024 WEO Update, forecasts for food
prices have been revised slightly downward, driven
by expectations of abundant global supplies for
wheat and maize.
• Monetary policy projections: With inflation projected to continue declining toward targets and
longer-term inflation expectations remaining
anchored, policy rates of central banks in major
advanced economies are generally expected to start
declining in the second half of 2024 (Figure 1.13).
Among major central banks, by the fourth quarter
of 2024, the Federal Reserve’s policy rate is expected
to have declined from its current level of about

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Global growth, estimated at 3.2 percent in 2023,
is projected to continue at the same pace in 2024
and 2025 (Table 1.1). The projection for 2024
is revised up by 0.1 percentage point from the
January 2024 WEO Update, and by 0.3 percentage point with respect to the October 2023 WEO
forecast (Figure 1.14). Nevertheless, the projection
for global growth in 2024 and 2025 is below the
historical (2000–19) annual average of 3.8 percent,
reflecting restrictive monetary policies and withdrawal
of fiscal support, as well as low underlying productivity growth. Advanced economies are expected to see
growth rise slightly, with the increase mainly reflecting
a recovery in the euro area from low growth in 2023,
whereas emerging market and developing economies
are expected to experience stable growth through 2024
and 2025, with regional differences.

5.4 percent to 4.6 percent, the Bank of England to
have reduced its policy rate from about 5.3 percent
to 4.8 percent, and the European Central Bank
to have reduced its short-term rate from about
4.0 percent to 3.3 percent. For Japan, policy rates
are projected to rise gradually, reflecting growing
confidence that inflation will sustainably converge to
target over the medium term despite Japan’s history
of deflation.
• Fiscal policy projections: Governments in advanced
economies are expected to tighten fiscal policy
in 2024 (Figure 1.13) and, to a lesser extent, in
2025–26. Among major advanced economies, the
structural fiscal-balance-to-GDP ratio is expected
to rise by 1.9 percentage points in the United
States and by 0.8 percentage point in the euro
area in 2024. In emerging market and developing
economies, the projected fiscal stance is expected
to be, on average, broadly neutral in 2024, with
a tightening of about 0.2 percentage point projected for 2025.

For advanced economies, growth is projected to rise
from 1.6 percent in 2023 to 1.7 percent in 2024 and
1.8 percent in 2025. The forecast is revised upward
by 0.2 percentage point for 2024 compared with the
January 2024 WEO Update projections and remains
the same for 2025. The 2024 upgrade reflects a revision to US growth, while an upward revision to the
US broadly offsets a similar downward revision to the
euro area in 2025.
• In the United States, growth is projected to increase
to 2.7 percent in 2024, before slowing to 1.9 percent in 2025, as gradual fiscal tightening and a
softening in labor markets slow aggregate demand.
For 2024, an upward revision of 0.6 percentage point since the January 2024 WEO Update
reflects largely statistical carryover effects from a
stronger-than-expected growth outcome in the
fourth quarter of 2023, with, in addition, some
of the stronger momentum expected to persist into 2024.
• Growth in the euro area is projected to recover from
its low rate of an estimated 0.4 percent in 2023,
which reflected relatively high exposure to the war
in Ukraine, to 0.8 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent
in 2025. Stronger household consumption, as the
effects of the shock to energy prices subside and a
fall in inflation supports growth in real income, is
expected to drive the recovery. The pace of recovery

is largely offset by upgrades for several smaller economies, including Belgium and Portugal.
• Among other advanced economies, growth in the
United Kingdom is projected to rise from an estimated 0.1 percent in 2023 to 0.5 percent in 2024,

as the lagged negative effects of high energy prices
wane, then to 1.5 percent in 2025, as disinflation
allows financial conditions to ease and real incomes
to recover. In Japan, output is projected to slow
from an estimated 1.9 percent in 2023 to 0.9 percent in 2024 and 1 percent in 2025, owing to
fading of one-off factors that supported growth in
2023, including a surge in inbound tourism.

Growth Forecast for Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
In emerging market and developing economies,
growth is expected to be stable at 4.2 percent in
2024 and 2025, with a moderation in emerging and
developing Asia offset mainly by rising growth for
economies in the Middle East and Central Asia and
for sub-Saharan Africa. Low-income developing countries are expected to experience gradually increasing
growth, from 4.0 percent in 2023 to 4.7 percent in
2024 and 5.2 percent in 2025, as some constraints on
near-term growth ease.
• Growth in emerging and developing Asia is expected
to fall from an estimated 5.6 percent in 2023 to
5.2 percent in 2024 and 4.9 percent in 2025,
a slight upward revision compared with the
January 2024 WEO Update. Growth in China
is projected to slow from 5.2 percent in 2023 to
4.6 percent in 2024 and 4.1 percent in 2025 as
the positive effects of one-off factors––including
the postpandemic boost to consumption and fiscal
stimulus––ease and weakness in the property sector
persists. Growth in India is projected to remain
strong at 6.8 percent in 2024 and 6.5 percent
in 2025, with the robustness reflecting continuing strength in domestic demand and a rising
working-age population.
• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is
projected at 3.2 percent in 2023 and 3.1 percent
12

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

in 2024, with an easing to 2.8 percent in 2025,
an upward revision of 0.5 percentage point for
2023 and 0.3 percentage point for 2024 and 2025
since January. The moderation reflects a prospective decline of growth in Russia from 3.2 percent
in 2024 to 1.8 percent in 2025 as the effects of
high investment and robust private consumption,
supported by wage growth in a tight labor market,
fade. In Türkiye, growth is projected at 3.1 percent
in 2024 and 3.2 percent in 2025, with economic
activity strengthening in the second half of 2024
as monetary tightening ends and consumption
starts to recover.
• In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is projected to decline from an estimated 2.3 percent in
2023 to 2.0 percent in 2024 before rising again to
2.5 percent in 2025, an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point for 2024 since January. In Brazil,
growth is expected to moderate to 2.2 percent in
2024 on the back of fiscal consolidation, lagged
effects of still-tight monetary policy, and a smaller
contribution from agriculture. In Mexico, growth
is projected at 2.4 percent in 2024, supported by
a fiscal expansion, before declining to 1.4 percent
in 2025 as the government is expected to tighten
the fiscal stance. The forecast for Mexico is revised
downward on account of weaker-than-expected outcomes for end-2023 and early 2024, with a contraction in manufacturing.

CHAPTER 1

• Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is projected to rise from an estimated 2.0 percent in 2023
to 2.8 percent in 2024 and 4.2 percent in 2025,
with a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point
for 2024 from the January 2024 projections. The
revision reflects a downward adjustment in the 2024
growth forecast for Iran driven by lower non-oil
activity and oil revenues, as well as for a number of
smaller economies.
• In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to rise
from an estimated 3.4 percent in 2023 to 3.8 percent in 2024 and 4.0 percent in 2025, as the
negative effects of earlier weather shocks subside
and supply issues gradually improve. The forecast is
unchanged for 2024 from the January 2024 WEO
Update, as a downward revision to Angola owing to
a contraction in the oil sector is broadly offset by an
upward revision to Nigeria.

Inflation Outlook: Declining at Different Speeds
Global headline inflation is expected to fall from
an annual average of 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.9 percent in 2024 and 4.5 percent in 2025 (Table 1.1).
A more front-loaded decline is expected for advanced
economies, with inflation falling by 2.0 percentage points in 2024, while it declines in 2025 only
in emerging market and developing economies.
Advanced economies are also expected to return
sooner to rates near their prepandemic (2017–19)
average, with inflation averaging 2.0 percent in 2025,
about a year before emerging market and developing
economies are expected to return to their prepandemic average near 5.0 percent (Figure 1.15). At the
same time, a great deal of differentiation is expected
among emerging market and developing economies,
with the inflation forecast ranging—among the five
regions––from only 2.4 percent for emerging and
developing Asia, reflecting subdued inflation in
China as well as in Thailand, to 18.8 percent for
emerging and developing Europe, reflecting elevated
inflation in Türkiye.
The global inflation forecast is revised upward by
0.1 percentage point in 2024 from the January 2024
projections. This reflects unchanged projections for
advanced economies—with decreases in the euro area,
Japan, and the United Kingdom compensated by an
increase in the United States—and an upside revision
of 0.2 percentage point in emerging market and developing economies, mainly on account of increases in
Iran and a few other low-income countries.

The fall in global inflation in 2024 reflects a
broad-based decline in global core inflation. This
dynamic differs from that in 2023, when global core
inflation fell a little on an annual average basis and
headline inflation declined mainly on account of lower
fuel and food price inflation. In 2024, core inflation is
expected to fall by 1.2 percentage points after contracting by just 0.2 percentage point in 2023. As is
the case for headline inflation, the fall in core inflation is faster for advanced economies. The drivers of
declining core inflation differ by country but include

the effects of still-tight monetary policies, a related
softening in labor markets, and fading pass-through
effects from earlier declines in relative prices, notably
in that of energy.
Among economies with an inflation target, headline
inflation is projected to be 0.5 percentage point above
target (or the midpoint of the target range) for the
median economy by the third quarter of 2024 on a
quarter-over-quarter basis (Figure 1.16). For advanced
economies, however, the median gap between actual
and target is expected to be just 0.3 percentage point
by the third quarter of 2024, implying a faster return
to target levels than in emerging market and developing economies. Most economies are expected to reach
levels within a quarter of a percentage point of their
targets (or the midpoints of their target ranges) by the
second quarter of 2025.

World Trade Outlook: Stable, in Line with Output
World trade growth is projected at 3.0 percent
in 2024 and 3.3 percent in 2025, with revisions of
a 0.3 percentage point decrease for 2024 and 2025
compared with January 2024 projections. Trade growth
is expected to remain below its historical (2000–19)
annual average growth rate of 4.9 percent over the
medium term, at 3.2 percent in 2029. This projection
implies, in the context of the relatively low outlook for

economic growth, a ratio of total world trade to GDP
(in current dollars) that averages 57 percent over the
next five years, broadly in line with the evolution in
trade since the global financial crisis (Figure 1.17).
Even as world trade-to-GDP ratios remain relatively
stable, significant shifts in trade patterns are taking place,
with increasing fractures along geopolitical lines, especially since the start of the war in Ukraine in February
2022. IMF staff analysis indicates that growth in trade
flows between geopolitical blocs has declined significantly
since then compared with growth of trade within blocs
(Box 1.1). This reallocation of trade flows is occurring in
the context of rising cross-border trade restrictions, with
about 3,200 new restrictions on trade in 2022 and about
3,000 in 2023, up from about 1,100 in 2019, according
to Global Trade Alert data, and increased concerns about
supply-chain resilience and national security.
Meanwhile, global current account balances—the
sums of absolute surpluses and deficits––are expected
to continue narrowing in 2024, as in 2023, following
their significant increase in 2022 (Figure 1.18). The
rise in current account balances in 2022 reflected contributions from elevated commodity prices, triggered
by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the uneven recovery
from the pandemic, and the rapid tightening of US
monetary policy. Over the medium term, global balances are expected to narrow gradually as the contribution of these factors wanes. Creditor and debtor stock
positions are estimated to have increased in 2023,

Medium-Term Growth Outlook: Low by
Historical Standards

before the onset of the pandemic (at the time of
the January 2020 WEO Update), the 4.9 percent
medium-term projection made just before the onset of
the global financial crisis (at the time of the April 2008
WEO), and the historical (2000–19) annual average
3.8 percent for actual global growth.3
The gradual erosion in global growth prospects
reflects factors beyond a more slowly rising global
population. The bulk of the decline reflects a fall
in prospective growth in GDP per person, which is
down from a medium-term forecast of 3.9 percent
made before the global financial crisis to 2.1 percent in the latest projections (Figure 1.19, panel 2).

The latest forecast for global growth in 2029 is
3.1 percent. This medium-term forecast—unchanged
since the October 2023 WEO—is at its lowest in decades (Figure 1.19). It is lower than the
medium-term projection of 3.6 percent made just

3The latest projection of global growth over the medium term,
which is based on the aggregation of IMF staff forecasts at the
country level, is broadly consistent with the assessment in Chapter 3
based on an analysis of recent trends in global capital and labor
accumulation and in total factor productivity.

with valuation losses in debtor economies and gains
in creditor economies more than offsetting narrowing
current account balances. These positions are expected
to stabilize over the medium term. In some economies,
gross external liabilities remain large from a historical
perspective and pose risks of external stress.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

The contraction in per person growth prospects
is especially pronounced for emerging market and
developing economies, implying a slower pace of convergence toward higher per person income and persistent global disparities in living standards. Among
advanced economies, the decline in medium-term
prospects is driven by countries other than the
United States.
Chapter 3 diagnoses the slowdown in global
growth over the past two decades and concludes
that most of it reflects lower growth in total factor productivity (efficiency in the use of labor and
capital). Among major economies, the drivers of this
slowdown include declining labor force participation
amid population aging, weaker business investment,
and––most important––a drag on growth resulting from persistent structural frictions that prevent
resources from being allocated to more productive
firms. As Chapter 4 explains, dimmer prospects for
growth in China and other large emerging market
economies that together make up an increasing share
of the global economy will weigh on the prospects
of trading partners and transmit through the world’s
highly integrated supply chains. Ongoing geoeconomic fragmentation––the policy-driven reversal
of cross-border economic integration––is expected
to affect the medium-term outlook by limiting
international flows of goods, services, capital, and
workers and so reduce scope for efficiency gains
from specialization, economies of scale, and competition (see Aiyar and others 2023 and Gopinath and
others 2024).

Risks to the Outlook: Broadly Balanced
Risks to the global economic landscape have
diminished since October 2023, leading to a broadly
balanced distribution of possible outcomes around
the baseline projection for global growth, from a clear
downside tilt in the April 2023 WEO and the October
2023 WEO. With inflationary pressures abating more
swiftly than expected in many countries, risks to
the inflation outlook are now also broadly balanced.
Overall, there is scope for further favorable surprises,
but numerous adverse risks pull the distribution of
outcomes in the opposite direction. Prominent risks
and uncertainties surrounding the outlook are now
discussed, and a model-based analysis that quantifies
risks to the global outlook and plausible scenarios
follows in Box 1.2.

text search results of the electronic archives of several newspapers covering
geopolitical tensions.

Downside Risks
Despite the surprisingly resilient global economic
performance since October 2023, several adverse risks
to global growth remain plausible:
• New commodity price spikes amid regional conflicts:
The conflict in Gaza and Israel could escalate further into the wider region. Continued attacks in the
Red Sea and the ongoing war in Ukraine risk generating additional supply shocks adverse to the global
recovery, with spikes in food, energy, and transportation costs. Further geopolitical tensions––including
a possible reescalation of the war in Ukraine––could
also constrain cross-border flows of food, fuel, and
fertilizer, causing additional price volatility and
undermining business and consumer sentiment
(Figure 1.20). As the risk analysis in Box 1.2 highlights, such geopolitical shocks could complicate
the ongoing disinflation process and delay central
bank policy easing, with negative effects on global
economic growth. Overall, such adverse supply
shocks may affect countries asymmetrically, with
particularly acute effects on lower-income countries
where food and energy constitute a large share of
household expenditure.
• Persistent inflation and financial stress: A
slower-than-expected decline in core inflation in
major economies as a result, for example, of persistent labor market tightness or renewed tensions

CHAPTER 1

in supply chains could trigger a rise in interest rate
expectations and a fall in asset prices, as in early
2023. Furthermore, as Chapter 2 explains, the risk
that the cooling effects of past monetary tightening are yet to come is plausible, especially where
fixed-rate mortgages are resetting and household
debt is high. Such developments could increase
defaults in many sectors—notably including commercial real estate and firms—and raise risks to
financial stability (see Chapter 1 of the April 2024
Global Financial Stability Report). They could also
trigger flight-to-safety capital flows, tighten global
financial conditions, and strengthen the US dollar
and so reduce global growth.
• China’s recovery faltering: In the absence of a comprehensive restructuring policy package for the troubled
property sector in China, a larger and more prolonged drop in real estate investment could occur,
accompanied by expectations of future house prices
declining, reduced housing demand, and a further
weakening in household confidence and spending,
with implications for global growth. Unintended
fiscal tightening on account of local government
financing constraints could amplify the impact. As
Box 1.2 illustrates, in such a scenario, the slowdown
in domestic demand could cause disinflationary
pressures to intensify, resulting in sustained low
inflation or deflation. Spillovers to China’s trading
partners in such a scenario are estimated to be,
on balance, negative, with effects through weaker
demand for trading-partner products outweighing
gains from lower commodity prices; global current
account imbalances may increase as a result. The
authorities’ policy responses could significantly
mitigate the economic costs of such developments
if they include accelerating the exit of nonviable
property developers, promoting the completion
of housing projects, and resolving the debt risks
of local governments. Additional monetary policy
easing, especially through lower interest rates, as well
as expansionary fiscal measures––including funding
of unfinished housing and support to vulnerable
households––could further support demand and
ward off deflationary risks.
• Disruptive fiscal adjustment and debt distress: Fiscal consolidation is necessary in many advanced
and emerging market and developing economies to curb debt-to-GDP ratios and rebuild
capacity for weathering future shocks. But an
excessively sharp shift to tax hikes and spending

cuts, beyond what is currently envisaged, could
result in slower-than-expected growth and reduce
reform momentum. Countries that lack a credible
medium-term consolidation plan could face adverse
market reactions or increased risks of debt distress
that force harsh adjustment. The experience of euro
area economies during 2010–15 illustrates how concerns about debt sustainability can cause significant
cuts to budget deficits that exceed initial projections
(Figure 1.21), with significant negative consequences
on growth. Despite recent improvement in international bond market conditions, the risk of debt distress in low-income countries continues to constrain
scope for necessary growth-enhancing investment.
The share of low-income countries (54 percent) and
emerging markets (16 percent) in or at high risk of
debt distress in 2024 remains elevated.
• Distrust of government eroding reform momentum:
Across broad income groups, confidence in government, legislative bodies, and political parties is
below 50 percent, by some measures (Figure 1.22).
Low confidence in governments and institutions,
amid political polarization in some cases, could
sap support for structural reforms, complicate
the adoption of and adaptation to technological
advances, create resistance to raising the revenue
needed to finance necessary investments, and
in some cases increase the risk of social unrest.

IMF staff research shows that discontent with
state institutions, often rooted in perceptions of
government policy failures in addressing inequality
and fostering inclusive growth, has fueled social
unrest and contributed to conflict (see Abdel-Latif
and El-Gamal 2024 for analysis based on data for
sub-Saharan Africa).
• Geoeconomic fragmentation intensifying: The separation of the world economy into blocs amid Russia’s
war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could
accelerate. Such a development could generate more
restrictions on trade and cross-border movements of
capital, technology, and workers and could hamper
international cooperation. IMF research suggests
that intensified geoeconomic fragmentation could
reduce portfolio and foreign direct investment
flows, slow the pace of innovation and technology
adoption, and constrain the flow of commodities
across fragmented blocs, resulting in large output
losses and commodity price volatility (see Aiyar
and others 2023; Chapter 4 of the April 2023
WEO; Chapter 3 of the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report; and Chapter 3 of the October
2023 WEO). In the context of upcoming elections
in numerous countries, moves to raise barriers to
the international flow of workers could reverse the
supply-side gains of recent years, exacerbate labor

18

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

market tightness and skill shortages, and raise inflationary pressures. Tariff increases could trigger retaliatory responses, raise costs, and harm both business
profitability and consumer well-being.

Upside Risks
More favorable outcomes for the global economy
than expected could arise from several sources:
• Short-term fiscal boost in the context of elections:
Many countries are expected to elect their national
governments in 2024—a “Great Election Year.”
In this context, policymakers may postpone fiscal
adjustment or commit to new expansionary measures. Studies suggest that fiscal deficits typically
rise during elections and that governments do not
tend to unwind the increases thereafter (Brender and
Drazen 2007; Dubois 2016; de Haan, Ohnsorge,
and Yu 2023; Chapter 1 of the April 2024 Fiscal
Monitor). In the near term, new expansionary
measures such as tax cuts, increased fiscal transfers,
and infrastructure investment could boost economic
activity, especially in economies in which sovereign
risk is perceived as low, and raise global growth
above current projections. However, such fiscal
expansions could add to inflationary pressures—
especially in countries with overheated economies
and steep inflation-unemployment trade-offs—and
result in higher interest rates, which would increase
the challenge of curbing debt. A more disruptive
policy adjustment could follow, with a negative
impact on growth.
• Further supply-side surprises, allowing for faster
monetary policy easing: Downside surprises to core
inflation on account of a faster-than-expected fading
of pass-through effects from past relative price
shocks and the easing of global supply constraints
are plausible in several cases. A faster-than-envisaged
compression of profit margins to absorb past cost
increases is also plausible. In the United States, for
example, where the labor market remains especially
tight, a stronger-than-expected downward shift
toward the prepandemic ratio of vacancies to unemployed persons could ease labor market conditions
and alleviate underlying inflationary pressures. Such
developments could lead to a greater-than-expected
decline in inflation expectations and allow central
banks to bring forward their policy-easing plans,
which would reduce borrowing costs, raise consumer
confidence, and reinforce global growth.

CHAPTER 1

• Spurs to productivity from artificial intelligence:
Recent advances in artificial intelligence, notably the
emergence of large language models and of generative pretrained transformers, have marked a leap
in the ability of technology to outperform humans
in several cognitive areas, as illustrated for selected
tasks in Figure 1.23. At the same time, as during the
introduction of past general-purpose technologies,
the impact of artificial intelligence on economic
outcomes, as well as its timing, remains highly
uncertain. In the near term, the rollout of artificial
intelligence could boost investment in some cases,
with firms allocating more resources to integrate
innovative tools and refine production processes.
IMF staff analysis suggests that over the medium
term, artificial intelligence could raise worker
productivity and incomes and contribute to growth
but also cause job displacement and inequality
(Cazzaniga and others 2024). Advanced economies
stand to benefit from artificial intelligence sooner
than emerging market and developing economies,
given the greater emphasis on cognitive-intensive
roles in the employment structures of the former.
In advanced economies, artificial intelligence could
affect about 60 percent of workers, with about
half of those exposed achieving higher productivity
and earning higher incomes and half seeing lower
demand for their labor and lower wages. Artificial
intelligence could affect about 40 percent of jobs
in emerging market economies and 26 percent of
jobs in low-income countries, implying a smaller
near-term labor market disruption and less scope for
related productivity improvements in economies in
those two groups.
• Structural reform momentum gathering:
Faster-than-expected implementation of macrostructural reforms could boost productivity
growth and contribute to higher medium-term
growth than in baseline forecasts, helping to heal
some of the “scarring” output losses from the
pandemic (Box 1.2). Reforms aimed at increasing
labor participation, reducing resource misallocation, and improving the allocation of talent could
revive economic activity and reverse the past two
decades of slower global growth, as Chapter 3
illustrates. IMF staff analysis also suggests that in
emerging market and developing economies with
constrained policy environments, faster progress
on implementing supply-enhancing reforms—
including those in the areas of governance, business

investment and growth (Budina and others 2023).
Stepped-up efforts to narrow gaps in labor market
participation by gender—beyond present policy
trends—would amplify the returns of such reforms
(Badel and Goyal 2023).

Globally Consistent Risk Assessment of the
World Economic Outlook Forecast
The risk of a hard landing has faded since the
October 2023 WEO, as the quantitative analysis in
Box 1.2, based on the IMF’s Group of Twenty (G20)
Model, illustrates. The estimated probability that
global growth in 2024 will fall below 2.0 percent—
an outcome that has occurred only five times since
1970––is now at about 10 percent, consistent with
an approximately symmetric risk distribution. This
estimated likelihood is down from an estimated
15 percent at the time of the October 2023 WEO.
For 2025, the probability of such an outcome is
also about 10 percent. A contraction in global per
capita real GDP—which often happens in a global
recession—in 2024 has an estimated probability below
5 percent. At the same time, the probability of global
growth’s exceeding the 3.8 percent historical average

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

19

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

during 2000–19 is slightly above 20 percent for 2024,
highlighting the relatively weak baseline outlook for
global growth. Turning to prices, the probability that
core inflation in 2024 will be higher than that in
2023, instead of declining to 4.9 percent in 2024 from
6.2 percent in 2023, is assessed at less than 10 percent,
consistent with a high level of confidence that disinflation will continue.

Policies: From Fighting Inflation to Restocking
Fiscal Arsenals
As the global economy approaches a soft landing,
the near-term priority for central banks is to ensure
that inflation comes down smoothly; they should
neither ease policies prematurely nor delay too long
and risk causing target undershoots. At the same
time, as central banks take a less restrictive stance, a
renewed focus on implementing medium-term fiscal
consolidation is in order to rebuild room for budgetary
maneuver and priority investments and to ensure debt
sustainability. Intensifying supply-enhancing reforms
would facilitate both inflation and debt reduction,
allow economies to increase growth toward the higher
prepandemic era average, and accelerate convergence
toward higher income levels. Multilateral cooperation
is needed to limit the costs and risks of geoeconomic
fragmentation and climate change, to accelerate the
transition to green energy, and to encourage debt
restructuring.

Delivering a Smooth Landing
With inflation receding and central banks considering the right timing of policy easing, ensuring that
wage and price pressures are clearly dissipating before
announcing moves to a less restrictive stance will
guard against having to tighten again later if inflation
surprises on the upside. Where core inflation persists
above target-consistent levels, higher real interest rates
may be necessary to achieve price stability. At the
same time, where near-term inflation expectations
and underlying inflation gauges are clearly declining
toward target, delays in nominal policy rate cuts risk
causing in practice a policy tightening, with rising real
policy rates and, considering long transmission lags,
economic weakness and target undershoots. In those
cases, moving rates gradually toward a more neutral
policy stance, while continuing to signal commitment
to price stability, is appropriate. In emerging market

20

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

economies in which a relatively early start to monetary
tightening has already allowed central banks to adjust
interest rates to lower but still-restrictive levels, it is
appropriate to proceed cautiously, guided by incoming
data on inflation expectations, currency movements,
and wage and price pressures.
As central bank policies become less synchronous,
divergence in rates among countries may spur capital flow movements and renewed strength in the US
dollar, which remains stronger than at any time in
the prepandemic decade and a half. Unexpectedly
persistent US inflation could, for example, trigger an
upward revision to US interest rate expectations and
cause a US dollar appreciation. In some cases, such
developments could put the financial sector under
pressure. Relatedly, the still-high borrowing costs in
numerous economies imply the need for strengthened
supervision (through implementation of Basel III,
among other measures) to anticipate banking sector
stress. In some cases, a recalibration of macroprudential
policies may be necessary in response to a fast-evolving
housing market.
In this context, the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework provides guidance on the appropriate policy
response, depending on country-specific circumstances.
For countries with deep foreign exchange markets
and low foreign currency debt, adjusting the policy
rate and allowing exchange rate flexibility are appropriate. Deploying—promptly and forcefully—tools
that provide liquidity support, while mitigating the
risk of moral hazard, would limit contagion where
market strains emerge. If foreign exchange markets
are shallow and countries have large foreign currency debts, a tightening of global financial conditions may be associated with “taper tantrums,” as
portfolio-constrained investors sell domestic currency
assets, and with systemic financial stability risks and
tail risks in growth outcomes. In such cases, it may be
appropriate to conduct foreign exchange intervention
or implement capital flow management measures while
keeping monetary and fiscal policy at their appropriate settings. Macroprudential policies should help
reduce financial vulnerabilities from large exposures
to foreign-currency-denominated debt. When there
is a risk of de-anchoring of inflation expectations
owing to a sharp exchange rate movement, foreign
exchange interventions can support monetary policy,
provided that there are enough reserves and the costs
from monetary policy alone are too high. Countries at
risk of external shocks can make full use of the global

Rebuilding Room for Budgetary Maneuver and Ensuring
Debt Sustainability

16

A renewed focus on fiscal consolidation to rebuild
budgetary room to deal with future shocks and curb the
rise of public debt is appropriate, since major central
banks are expected to ease monetary policy this year
and economies are in a better position to absorb the
economic effects of fiscal tightening. The size of the
fiscal adjustment needed to ensure government debt
sustainability is large in numerous cases (see the April
2024 Fiscal Monitor). To illustrate this point, Figure 1.24 compares the latest projections for the rise in
the general government primary fiscal balance between
2023 and 2029 for selected G20 economies with the
increase needed to stabilize the general government
debt-to-GDP ratio in 2029. The figure also reports the
additional adjustment needed to reduce debt to its 2019
level in 2029. At the interest rates currently envisaged
to hold on to the total stock of debt, which includes
debt issued during the prepandemic low-interest
environment, the currently foreseen adjustment over
2023–29 is sufficient to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio
in 2029 in most—although not all—cases. However,
the projected adjustment is generally not sufficient to
return debt to 2019 levels. As the figure illustrates, the
adjustment needed to achieve such a debt reduction
is even more challenging when assessed at the interest
rates that currently apply to newly issued debt. With
elections in a number of countries in 2024, ensuring
that any new tax cuts or spending increases are funded
and do not expand budget deficits is necessary to preserve the envisaged fiscal adjustment path.
• Calibrating the pace of adjustment: Fiscal adjustment
should be gradual and sustained, where possible,
given its generally negative effects on economic
activity in the near term. Avoiding an abrupt
adjustment is warranted to avert the risk that sharp
expenditure cutbacks or tax increases will set off a
negative cycle of slowing activity and rising debt
ratios and undercut political support for fiscal
reforms, which can often take time to implement.
Front-loaded adjustment may be necessary to reduce
the likelihood of a debt crisis, especially in economies that have lost market access. For countries
with elevated inflation, fiscal consolidation can, by

denotes the real interest rate based on the currently prevailing rate at the 10-year
bond maturity (as of March 31, 2024). China’s deficit and public debt numbers

estimates in China Article IV reports (see IMF 2024 for a reconciliation of the two

reducing aggregate demand and reinforcing the overall credibility of disinflation strategies, further ease
inflation. Supply-enhancing structural reforms and
protecting targeted support for the most vulnerable,
as well as priority investments during the adjustment, can mitigate the impact on economic activity
and support debt reduction efforts over the medium
term (see Chapter 3 of the April 2023 WEO and
Aligishiev and others 2023).
• Building credibility with well-specified plans and a
strong institutional framework: To reduce policy
uncertainty, committing to measures sufficient
to meet medium-term targets based on realistic
assumptions about the short-term growth effects of
fiscal consolidation, interest rates, and the budgetary yield of revenue and spending policy changes is
essential. With energy prices returning to prepandemic levels, phasing out untargeted fiscal measures,
especially those that blunt price signals, is warranted.

Fostering Faster Productivity Growth
Structural reforms can support productivity growth
and reverse declining medium-term growth prospects
if they are targeted and carefully sequenced. Prioritizing reforms that relax the most binding constraints on
economic activity can lead to output and productivity gains, even in the short term (Budina and others
2023). Reforms that address the persistent misallocation of resources can play a central role in boosting
productivity, as the scenarios in Chapter 3 illustrate. In
this vein, narrowing gender gaps to correct the misallocation of women’s talents and abilities would further
contribute to enhancing aggregate productivity (Sayeh,
Badel, and Goyal 2023).
The particular steps needed are country specific and
in several cases include reforms that strengthen governance, reduce excessive business regulation and restrictions on trade, and improve access to foreign capital.
These reforms can pave the way to deeper structural
changes––including those necessary for a transition to
cleaner energy sources––by fostering job and income
growth and strengthening public support. Bundling
reforms and appropriate sequencing of other reforms,

growth and interest rate movements—or to other
country-specific developments—can bolster credibility. IMF staff analysis that builds on Blanchard
(2022) indicates that agencies that rate sovereign
debt reward reductions in debt-to-GDP ratios but
that they also place a high premium on institutional
quality (see Figure 1.25). At the same time, promises of future adjustment alone are unlikely to build
credibility, and a steady pace of fiscal consolidation
with a nontrivial first installment is warranted.
• Addressing debt distress: For countries in debt distress, debt restructuring, conducted in an orderly
manner, may be necessary. Progress in improving
international sovereign debt resolution frameworks
is moving in the right direction. The G20 Common
Framework has started to deliver, with each successive case building on previous experiences to achieve
faster coordination. The Global Sovereign Debt
Roundtable is helping foster greater common understanding of processes and principles for facilitating
more timely and predictable restructurings. It is
important to continue to build on this progress and
to improve the efficiency of creditor coordination
in cases that are not eligible for treatment under the
Common Framework.

such as labor market and credit market reforms, can
front-load gains. Harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence will require developing adequate
regulatory frameworks and investing in foundational
infrastructure and digital skills training. Complementary reforms would be needed to support misplaced
workers and their retraining. Industrial policies can
be pursued where clearly identifiable externalities or
important market failures are well established and
other more effective policy options are unavailable, but
the policies should avoid protectionist provisions and
need to be consistent with World Trade Organization
(WTO) rules.

Speeding the Green Transition and Building
Climate Resilience
Large global policy action gaps persist for reaching
greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals consistent
with limiting global average temperature increases
to 1.5–2.0°C above preindustrial levels. To achieve

CHAPTER 1

emissions reduction targets, countries need a holistic
set of mitigation instruments, ideally including carbon
pricing, public infrastructure investment in clean energy
sources, sectoral policies, regulations, and reductions in
fossil-fuel subsidies. Carbon border-adjustment mechanisms and incentive programs for green investments
can speed the green transition but need to be designed
to be consistent with WTO rules. Fiscal incentives to
shift to clean energy sources are also needed. The energy
transition will need to be managed carefully to address
risks over the longer term to the energy security of some
countries if the scaling back of investments in fossil fuels
is not adequately matched by corresponding increases in
alternative clean energy supplies. In parallel, investments
in climate adaptation activities and infrastructure are
needed, especially for regions most vulnerable to climate
shocks. Enhancing climate-risk-monitoring systems
and risk management frameworks and stronger safety
nets and insurance are also needed to enhance climate
resilience (see Chapter 1 of the October 2023 Fiscal
Monitor). Mobilizing climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation in low-income countries will require
coordinated efforts by international organizations,
private investors, country authorities, and donors.

Strengthening Cross-Border Cooperation
Multilateral cooperation is necessary to mitigate
fragmentation and strengthen the resilience of the
international monetary system. Policymakers should

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

maintain stable and transparent trade policies and
avoid discriminatory policies that induce trade
and investment distortions. An intergovernmental
dialogue on—or a consultation framework for—
industrial policies could help improve data and information sharing and identify the impact of policies,
including their unintended consequences across
borders. Over time, steady lines of communication
could help in developing international rules and
norms on the appropriate use and design of industrial policies, making it easier for firms to adjust to
the new environment. Cooperation is also required
for the orderly resolution of debt problems to clear
a path through an increasingly complex creditor
landscape. Furthermore, international coordination
is vital to mitigate the effects of climate change and
facilitate the transition to green energy, building
on recent agreements at the 2023 Conference of
the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change. Safeguarding the transportation of
critical minerals, restoring the WTO’s ability to settle
trade disputes, and ensuring the responsible use of
potentially disruptive new technologies such as artificial intelligence by, among other things, upgrading
domestic regulatory frameworks and harmonizing
global principles are priorities. Establishing the free
flow of low-carbon technologies—which facilitate
emissions reductions––from advanced economies to
emerging market and developing economies would
further support meeting climate targets.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box 1.1. Fragmentation Is Already Affecting International Trade
Geoeconomic fragmentation could weigh on world
trade and income growth in the coming years. Data on
bilateral goods trade before and after Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine in February 2022 confirm that fragmentation is already underway (see also World Trade
Organization 2023).
Trade between economies in politically distant blocs
has slowed more than trade between those within
blocs since the start of the war in Ukraine. To shed
light on the evolution of trade fragmentation, the
analysis illustrated in Figure 1.1.1 assigns countries to
a hypothetical bloc including Australia, Canada, the
European Union, New Zealand, and the United States
or a hypothetical bloc comprising China, Russia, and
countries that sided with Russia during the March 2,
2022, UN General Assembly vote on Ukraine, with all
other countries considered nonaligned. The analysis compares the average growth rate of trade flows
between members of each bloc during two periods:
the period after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (from the
second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2023)
and the five years leading up to the invasion (from the
first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2022).
Growth in goods trade between the two blocs has
been significantly weaker since the start of the war
than growth in goods trade within blocs. Total goods
trade has slowed by about 2.4 percentage points more
between countries not in the same bloc than among
those in the same bloc. The relationship is especially
strong for trade in strategic sectors, such as chemicals
and machinery, in which trade has slowed by about
4 percentage points more among countries not in
the same bloc. Gopinath and others (2024) provide
further corroborating evidence based on gravity
models of trade. Additional analysis suggests that these
results are robust to alternative bloc definitions and
are not driven exclusively by China and the United
States. They hold based on a subsample of bilateral
trade flows excluding pairs of economies in which one
partner is either China or the United States (Gopinath
and others 2024).
Another aspect of fragmentation is that trade links
are weakening between China and the United States.

with tariffs rising on trade between the two countries,
China’s share of US goods imports has fallen by almost
8 percentage points (from 22 percent in 2017 to
14 percent in 2023, according to US Census Bureau
data). At the same time, some evidence suggests that
US sourcing was partly reallocated away from China
and towards other countries during 2017-2022,
including Mexico and Vietnam (Alfaro and Chor
2023; Freund and others 2023; Wang and Hannan
2023). As a result, supply chains are lengthening,
with possible losses in efficiency (Qiu, Shin, and
Zhang 2023).
If fragmentation continues, with countries imposing
additional restrictions on trade, efficiency losses from
declines in specialization, smaller gains from economies of scale, and reduced competition could be
significant (see Aiyar and others 2023).

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2. Risk Assessment Surrounding the World Economic Outlook’s Baseline Projections
The IMF’s Group of Twenty (G20) Model is used in
this box to derive confidence bands around the World
Economic Outlook (WEO) forecast and to quantify
alternative scenarios.
Risks to global growth are considered broadly balanced. Uncertainty about 2024 has decreased since the
October 2023 WEO, as the outturns for 2023 are now
known. The risk that global growth will fall below
2 percent—an outcome that has occurred on only five
occasions since 1970—in 2024 is assessed at less than
10 percent, compared with 15 percent in October.
Risks for inflation in 2024 have also receded. The risk
that core inflation will be higher in 2024 than in 2023
is now assessed at less than 10 percent, compared with
15 percent in the October 2023 WEO. The scenarios
quantify several risks to the outlook: (1) the extent of
healing from the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) changes
in fiscal policy, (3) deflation in China, (4) geopolitical
risk, and (5) greater global divergence.

Confidence Bands
The methodology for producing confidence bands
is based on Andrle and Hunt (2020) and has been
used in previous WEO reports. The G20 model, presented in Andrle and others (2015) is used to interpret historical data on output, inflation, policy rates,
and international commodity prices to recover the
implied economic shocks to aggregate demand and
supply. The recovered shocks are sampled through
nonparametric methods and fed back through the
model to generate predictive distributions around the
WEO projections. Shocks are sampled uniformly,
consistent with balanced risks to the outlook. A difference relative to October is that 2023 outturns are
now known for most countries, which narrows the
distribution around 2024 projections.

Figure 1.2.1 shows the resulting distributions for
global growth and inflation projections. Each shade of
blue represents a 5 percentage point interval, and each
band covers 90 percent of the distribution. Regarding
global growth, there is a 70 percent probability that
growth will be between 2.4 percent and 4.1 percent
in 2024—a narrower range than in October—and a
70 percent probability that growth will be between
2.2 percent and 4.3 percent in 2025.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box 1.2 (continued)
Regarding global inflation, uncertainty around
2024 outcomes has also narrowed since the previous
WEO report. There is a 70 percent probability that
2024 headline inflation will be about 1.3 percentage
points higher or lower than currently projected, with
the resulting band smaller than the 1.8 percent band
estimated in October. The probability that headline inflation will be higher in 2024 than in 2023
is about 20 percent, compared with 25 percent in
October. Similarly, the probability that core inflation will be higher in 2024 than in 2023 is assessed
at less than 10 percent, compared with 15 percent
back in October.

Scenarios
The G20 model is also used to quantify several risk
scenarios relevant for the current outlook. The scenarios assume that monetary policy and automatic fiscal
stabilizers respond endogenously to macro developments, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Greater-than-expected healing from the pandemic.
Persistent positive surprises to growth forecasts from
emerging market economies, and some advanced economies, over the past year have led to upward reassessments of potential output. At the same time, current
WEO projections for most G20 countries include
durable scarring effects from the pandemic and other
recent shocks, which are most visible in labor productivity and labor force participation rates that remain
below prepandemic trends. The scenario assumes the
supply-side surprises continue over the medium term,
with greater normalization (healing) over 2024–26
than in the baseline, implying additional increases in
potential output. Country-specific improvements in
total factor productivity help close the labor productivity gap by half relative to prepandemic forecasts:
For the median G20 country, total factor productivity
increases by about 2 percent over this period. Labor
force participation also improves over the same period,
fully closing the gap that opened through COVID-19,
back to the prepandemic trend—and implying a
0.7 percentage point increase in labor force participation for the median G20 country. Normalization in
the scenario is greater in emerging markets excluding
China than in advanced economies, as current projections imply greater scarring for the former group. The
scenario does not assume supply-side improvement
(relative to baseline) for China or the United States.
Fiscal policy. Current WEO projections include
modest fiscal tightening in many countries, mainly

advanced economies, but also some emerging markets, with structural primary deficits in the median
G20 country decreasing from about 1.5 percent of
potential GDP in 2023 to zero by 2028 and most of
the decrease in the first or second year. The scenario assumes that the fiscal tightening envisaged
for 2024–25 does not take place. Structural primary
deficits remain at their 2023 levels in 2024 and
increase further in 2025, implying some fiscal stimulus relative to the baseline in both years, as shown
in Table 1.2.1. The stimulus is greater in countries
with larger expected fiscal withdrawal, such as the
United States and the euro area in 2024 and Japan
in 2025, while no stimulus is assumed for China.
Lack of fiscal consolidation generates an increase in
global borrowing costs starting in 2025. Advanced
economies with debt levels above 100 percent of
GDP experience increases in both term and sovereign
premiums that peak at 100 basis points by 2026,
while emerging markets experience increases in both
premiums that peak at 150 basis points, also by
2026. A fiscal consolidation eventually takes place,
in 2026–27; it is larger than in current projections
to partly offset the effects of the initial expansion
(and higher premiums) on debt accumulation. It
is assumed that fiscal expansions and contractions
are implemented through changes in targeted and
general transfers in equal parts and that automatic
stabilizers are turned off.
Deflation in China. The October 2023 WEO
included a downside scenario for China, featuring
deeper-than-expected contraction in the real estate
sector absent swift action to restructure property
developers and weaker consumption in the context of subdued confidence. A similar if somewhat
greater downside is analyzed here. The main difference relative to October is that the scenario leads
to greater deflationary pressures, on account of
larger-than-realized economy-wide slack and excess

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2 (continued)
capacity in the goods sector, and greater sensitivity
of inflation to supply-demand imbalances (a steeper
Phillips curve). Core inflation in China declines
relative to baseline by 1 percentage point in 2024
and 2 percentage points in 2025 and 2026, resulting in negative core inflation outturns in 2025–26.
China’s export price inflation decreases further, by
2 percentage points in 2024 and 4 percentage points
in 2025 and 2026, respectively. The fall in inflation
is persistent but ultimately temporary: monetary and
fiscal policy accommodation help the initial shock
to demand fade, and China’s inflation gradually converges back to baseline after 2026.
Geopolitical risk. The scenario assumes that an
escalation of conflict in the Middle East leads to a
surge in oil prices and in shipping costs. Oil prices
are 15 percent higher, a moderate increase by historical standards. Average container prices rise by
150 percent in 2024–25, an increase similar to that
following recent incidents in the Red Sea. Most of
the increase in the cost of shipping is concentrated in
Asia-to-Europe routes. Oil prices and container costs
return to baseline in 2026.
Divergence and global financial conditions. The
final scenario assumes greater-than-expected divergence
among advanced economies. US aggregate demand
surprises to the upside, with domestic demand
increasing by 1.5 percent in 2024 relative to current
projections, while domestic demand decreases by
0.5 percent in Japan and 1 percent in the euro area in
2024. Diverging shocks to demand lead to divergence
in monetary policy—tighter in the US and looser
in the euro area—while monetary policy in Japan is
unchanged relative to baseline. With US policy rates
70 basis points higher than baseline in 2024, global
financial conditions tighten unexpectedly. Sovereign
premiums in emerging markets and developing countries excluding China increase by 150 basis points in
2024–25; corporate premiums increase in emerging
market and advanced economies by 75 basis points
over the same period. Premiums return to long-term
averages in 2026.

Box 1.2 (continued)
expansion, but the increase is larger in the latter group,
especially emerging markets excluding China (shown
in Figure 1.2.2 instead of the emerging markets aggregate). The effect on inflation is close to zero, reflecting
two offsetting forces. Output increases somewhat less
than potential, which leads to mild declines in core
inflation. At the same time, the expansion in global
activity pushes oil prices up gradually over the WEO
horizon, adding to headline inflation.
The fiscal scenario generates a whipsaw-like movement in activity, inflation, and policy rates. Global
output initially increases relative to baseline, peaking
at 0.5 percent in 2025. Activity in advanced economies rises by more than that in emerging markets, as
most of the fiscal expansion takes place in the former.
Global inflation is about 30 basis points higher, on
average, during 2024–25. Monetary policy is correspondingly tighter; for example, policy rates in the
US increase by 100 basis points relative to baseline by
2025. As borrowing costs rise and fiscal policy goes
from stimulus to withdrawal, there is a great reversal
in global activity in 2026–27. The reversal is more
pronounced in advanced economies, with growth falling by about 1 percent relative to current projections
in both 2026 and 2027. As a result, global inflation is
about 60 basis points lower during 2026–27. Monetary policy turns accommodative during that period;
for reference, US policy rates are 75 basis points lower
than baseline by 2027.
The China deflation scenario results in lower
global activity, with global GDP falling cumulatively
by 0.5 percent relative to current projections by 2025.
The impact is smaller than in the October 2023
scenario and mostly results from the direct impact on
China’s GDP. Activity spillovers to advanced economies and other emerging markets are close to zero,
with two forces broadly offsetting each other. While
lower activity in China reduces global demand, the
large decrease in Chinese export prices benefits the rest
of the world by improving terms of trade, lowering inflation, and raising purchasing power outside
China. Inflation in advanced economies and emerging
markets excluding China is 20 basis points lower, on

28

average, during the 2024–26 period for both headline
and core measures. Policy rates outside China are
also lower, with US rates 40 basis points lower than
baseline by 2025.
The geopolitical risk scenario results in a negative global supply shock. Global headline inflation
increases by close to 70 basis points in 2024 and
remains 25 basis points above baseline in 2025. While
much of the increase reflects the direct effect of higher
oil prices, core inflation also increases by about 20–30
basis points in 2024–25, reflecting second-round
effects from higher oil prices and higher production
costs from disruptions to international shipping. Monetary policy tightens relative to baseline, with rates
in both advanced economies and emerging markets
about 30 to 40 basis points higher in 2025. The hit to
purchasing power and tighter monetary policy lower
global activity by as much as 0.4 percent by 2025. The
impact on inflation and activity is broadly similar in
advanced economies and emerging markets; within
advanced economies the effect is slightly larger in
Europe than in the United States, on account of the
greater impact from shipping costs.
Finally, the global impact from greater global
divergence builds over time. In advanced economies,
upside surprises to activity and inflation in the United
States are initially offset by downside surprises in other
countries. The increase in US output is smaller than
the initial shock, as the dollar appreciates against currencies in advanced and emerging market economies
by 2 and 5 percent, respectively, in nominal terms
in 2024 and global demand for US exports falls. In
emerging markets, the depreciation provides support
to export demand, and initially offsets the impact
from tighter domestic financial conditions, while also
leading to a modest increase in inflation. The global
negative implications become more visible in 2025,
as tighter financial conditions increasingly affect
activity in advanced economies (outside of the United
States) and emerging markets. Global output falls by
0.4 percent in 2025, and global headline inflation
falls by about 25 basis points below baseline over the
same period.

the Power of Prices
Primary commodity prices declined slightly between
August 2023 and February 2024, driven by a decrease
in oil prices. Supply growth in the Americas surprised
on the upside, buffering the impact of geopolitical
tensions in the Middle East. Food and beverage prices
increased, driven by the impact of El Niño on tropical crops. Iron ore prices rebounded due to record steel
production in China. Gold prices were supported by
safe haven demand. This Special Feature analyzes price
elasticities of commodity demand and supply in depth.

Commodity Market Developments
Oil prices decreased despite Middle East tensions. After
breaking $95 a barrel in late September, oil prices
decreased by 4.2 percent between August 2023 and
February 2024, when they stood at a monthly average
of $80.70. On the demand side, weaker expectations
about global demand growth have contributed to
downward price pressures. On the supply side, the
implementation of output curbs by OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus
selected nonmember countries, including Russia) was
more than offset by strong output growth in Iran and
non-OPEC countries, led by the United States, Brazil,
and Guyana (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 3).
Red Sea tensions have led to a 50 percent rise in
global freight rates of oil product tankers. Among
the main routes affected is the one from the Middle
East to Europe (Figure 1SF.1, panel 4), for which
prices increased by 200 percent from mid-November
2023 to mid-March 2024. The higher costs and the
implied rerouting have only had a minor impact on
crude oil prices. Russian oil, primarily exported to
China and India, was mostly above the Group of
Seven price cap since the second half of 2023, at a
$15–$20 discount (based on Argus data).
Futures markets suggest that oil prices will slide
by 2.5 percent year over year to average $78.60 per
barrel in 2024 and will continue to fall to $67.50
in 2029. Risks to this price outlook are balanced.
Upside price risks could arise from an escalation

of the Middle East conflict and attacks on Russian
oil infrastructure. Downside risks could arise from
a slowdown in Chinese oil demand and strong
non-OPEC supply growth, possibly coupled with
a rise in OPEC+ oil supply to regain market share.
The outlook for demand growth is highly uncertain.
Natural gas prices continued to decline amid ample
supplies. Title Transfer Facility (TTF) trading hub
prices in Europe fell 24.4 percent from August 2023
to $8.10 a million British thermal units (MMBtu) in
February 2024—within the upper range of historical
prices. Mild weather, low industrial demand in Europe,
and ample liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies have
led to high gas storage levels and lower prices (see
also Albrizio and others 2022, 2023). Asian prices for
LNG declined by 24.9 percent. US Henry Hub prices
decreased by 32.3 percent. Futures markets suggest
that TTF prices will average $9.45 in 2024, decreasing
to $8.73 in 2029. Henry Hub prices may rise from
an average of $2.66 per MMBtu in 2024 to $3.63
in 2029, as US export capacity is expected to almost
double from 11.4 billion cubic feet a day (bcf/d) to
21.1 bcf/d until 2027, according to the US Energy
Information Administration. Risks around this outlook
are balanced.
Metals prices rebounded. After declining during the
summer, the IMF’s base metals price index rose by
4.7 percent from August 2023 to February 2024. Iron
ore prices increased by 14.9 percent due to record steel
production in China. Uranium prices rose by 75.3 percent to their highest level since 2007 due to supply
disruptions from major producers, a potential ban on
Russian exports, and better prospects for nuclear power
production to combat climate change. Geopolitical
tensions and expectations of monetary policy easing
raised gold prices by 5.5 percent.
Agricultural commodity prices rebounded. Between
August 2023 and February 2024, the IMF’s food and
beverages price index gained 6.0 percent, masking
heterogeneity. Prices for cereals and vegetable oils
continued to decline, by 7.2 percent and 10.9 percent,
respectively, on the back of abundant global supplies.
Concerns related to El Niño put upward pressure on
the prices of certain tropical crops, including cocoa
(64.2 percent) and coffee (18.2 percent). Coffee prices,
especially those for Robusta, experienced upward price
pressure from tensions in the Red Sea, which led some
consumer countries to switch from Asian to Brazilian imports. Rubber prices jumped 39.8 percent as
global output declined in 2023 following the outbreak

of a novel leaf disease in Asia. Seafood prices surged
25.9 percent as demand outstripped supply growth,
partly because of stricter environmental legislation in
some countries. Risks to the price outlook are balanced. Upside risks stem from further trade disruptions
in the Black Sea and new food export restrictions.
Larger-than-expected harvests constitute the most
important downside risk.

The Power of Prices: How Fast Do Commodity
Markets Adjust to Shocks?
The pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the
conflict in Gaza and Israel generated shocks that led
to a surge in commodity price volatility (Figure 1.
SF.2). This volatility destabilized inflation, and made
fiscal and monetary policy more difficult, especially
for low-income and commodity-exporting countries.
Geoeconomic fragmentation and climate change
could lead to more commodity market turbulences.
The resulting price volatility could crucially hinge on
the price elasticities of demand and supply. The lower
those elasticities, the more prices react to unexpected
changes in supply and demand (see Albrizio and others
2022, 2023).
It is therefore essential to understand to what
extent commodity supply and demand are slow to
react. Is demand more price sensitive than supply?

The HHI ranges between indicating perfectly equal production across the 195
countries in our sample and 1 (indicating perfect inequality).

Do the quantities supplied and demanded adjust
more strongly over the long term? Are the elasticities
different across energy, agricultural, and mineral commodities? What policies make commodity supply and
demand more reactive?
This Special Feature presents a consistently identified and estimated set of price elasticities of demand
and supply for a broad range of commodities.1 Based
on a granular instrumental variable approach (Gabaix
and Koijen, forthcoming), an annual cross-country
data set on agricultural goods, energy, and metals from
1960 to 2021 is employed.2

1This feature is based on Bogmans and others (2024). It fills a gap
in the literature because surveys such as Dahl (2020) and Fally and
Sayre (2018) mix estimates based on different methodologies. This
is a major pitfall when models include several commodities (see, for
example, Fally and Sayre 2018 and Bolhuis, Chen, and Kett 2023).
The estimates are often based on correlations and suffer from biases
(Roberts and Schlenker 2013). This feature also contributes to the
literature estimating elasticities using vector autoregressive models
(see Kilian 2022, Baumeister and Hamilton 2022, and Kilian and
Zhou 2023).

Bems and others (2023), and Schwerhoff and Stuermer (2020),
among others. The online annex is available at www​.imf​.org/​en/​
Publications/​WEO.

Commodity Shocks
The methodology uses idiosyncratic changes in
commodity production and consumption in individual
countries to estimate average global price elasticities.
This works only if these shocks are large enough to
affect global prices, which, in turn, manifests as high
market concentration.
Most commodity markets are in fact highly concentrated in their production and consumption, as
elevated Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHIs) in
Figure 1.SF.3 show. For example, for palm oil the production HHI is 0.4, roughly 80 times higher than the
value of the HHI if all 195 countries in the world had
the same market share (red line). This means that an
idiosyncratic shock in palm oil production most likely
affects palm oil prices globally.
Figure 1.SF.4 shows that these country-specific idiosyncratic shocks are a substantial driver of fluctuations
in global commodity production and consumption.
Still, common factors are, on average, the stronger
driver. One explanation is global supply chains. For
example, shocks to shipping can manifest as a common factor across countries on the supply side. In line
with this explanation, common factors have increased
particularly in their role in the output of industrial
commodities over the past decade. Common factors
have also gained significance in the consumption of
both food and industrial commodities (see also Jacks
and Stuermer 2021). More synchronized global business cycles may offer an explanation (de Soyres and
Gaillard 2020).
For food commodities idiosyncratic shocks in
production are bigger than those in consumption. This
is not the case for industrial commodities. Agricultural production can be affected more by idiosyncratic
country-specific shocks such as droughts, flooding, or
pests that can affect local yields.

Commodities Are Mostly Inelastic
In terms of supply elasticities, results show that
metals, especially copper and zinc, tend to have the
lowest elasticities, while agricultural commodities have
the highest (see Figure 1.SF.5). For example, copper
and zinc have a supply elasticity close to zero. In contrast, the results for cereals show a supply elasticity of
about 0.6, implying that a 10 percent increase in prices
raises output by 6 percent within a year. This is in line
with the fact that crop switching, or the application
of more fertilizer is possible within a year, whereas the

other commodities, more efficient use, and substitution of other products for downstream products.
For agricultural goods, rice is atypical, showing
a price elasticity of demand close to zero, probably
reflecting that only about 10 percent of output is internationally traded. Rice prices are also typically subsidized in Asia. Elasticities for tea, cotton, and wheat
are above 0.4. For crude oil and coal, the results show
demand elasticities below 0.2, in line with the difficulties of switching fuels over the short term because
of technical constraints. Finally, copper and zinc have
demand elasticities close to zero, whereas those for lead
and tin are between 0.2 and 0.3. The former metals are
essential for electrical appliances and steel production,
respectively. Lead and tin are easier to substitute.

expansion and opening of mines is subject to longer
lead times.
A distinction exists between perennial crops such as
coffee, palm oil, and cocoa, on one hand, and annual
crops like soybeans on the other. Perennial crops are
characterized by smaller short-term supply elasticities
compared with those for annual crops. It takes an
extended period for new trees to produce fruit: typically,
two years for palm oil and five years for cocoa. The
supply elasticities of energy commodities tend to be
between those for mineral and agricultural commodities.
Elasticities on the demand side are determined less
by commodity groups. Instead, commodity-specific
characteristics seem to play a larger role. This is in line
with several mechanisms that allow for demand-side
adjustment across all commodities: substitution by

32

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

Commodity supply and demand become more
responsive over time as markets adjust to shocks
(Figure 1.SF.5). However, long-term multipliers show
notable differences across commodities at different
horizons. Results for most agricultural commodities
indicate that supply responses are flat over a five-year
horizon. Elasticities for perennial crops like coffee,
cocoa, and rubber still show a statistically significant
strong peak about two to three years after a shock. For
most metals and energy, supply elasticities are upward
sloping, but only the one for copper is statistically
significant. On the demand side, results are generally
not very precisely estimated. Metals show the largest
increases in the multipliers over longer horizons. At
the same time, for most agricultural commodities, the
demand multipliers do not become larger.
Demand and supply for agricultural goods seem
generally more responsive to shocks than those for
minerals and energy commodities. This is consistent
with the smaller price volatility observed for agricultural goods, compared with that for metals and energy
commodities (Figure 1.SF.2). Agricultural commodities
also see the least increase in their responsiveness after a
couple of years, whereas mineral commodities become
more responsive.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
This Special Feature estimated a broad set of supply
and demand elasticities for commodities based on a
consistent identification methodology and a unique
data set. The results show that commodity demand

and supply are generally price inelastic, but that differences exist. The supply of agricultural perennial crops
is more inelastic than that of annual crops. This may
explain why wheat prices, which spiked at the start
of the war in Ukraine, have now come down below
prewar levels. Demand elasticities may have also played
a role, since within cereals, cross-elasticities of demand
allow for substitution. Supply and demand of mineral commodities are particularly inelastic. Those for
energy commodities are between those for agricultural
commodities and those for metals. At the same time,
supply and demand become more elastic for mineral
and energy commodities over time.
Countries exposed to commodity markets with
relatively low elasticities, especially metals, could

34

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

build fiscal buffers and monetary policy space to
prepare for the larger impact of possible shocks. As
elasticities ultimately reflect adjustments made by
final consumers and producers, replacing energy and
agricultural subsidies with targeted transfers would
help increase the demand and supply elasticities of
many commodities and could reduce their price volatility. International trade can also play a prominent
role in smoothing out commodity shocks and buffer
against their economic impact (see Albrizio and
others 2022, 2023; and Alvarez and others 2023).
This will be even more relevant in the context of
increasing geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation as well as in the case of critical minerals for the
energy transition.

FEELING THE PINCH? TRACING THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY
THROUGH HOUSING MARKETS

Central banks around the world have raised policy rates
significantly over the past two years. Many observers
thought higher rates would lead to a slowdown or even
a recession, but global growth has held steady. At the
same time, some economies are in fact slowing down.
Why are some feeling the pinch from higher rates
and not others? This chapter investigates the effects of
monetary policy across countries and over time through
the lens of mortgage and housing markets. Monetary
policy has greater effects where (1) fixed-rate mortgages
are not common, (2) home buyers are more leveraged,
(3) national household debt is high, (4) housing supply
is more restricted, and (5) house prices have recently
been overvalued. Because these characteristics vary
significantly across countries, this chapter’s main message is that the effects of monetary policy are strong in
some countries and weak in others. Moreover, shifts in
mortgage and housing markets since the global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic may
have limited the drag of higher policy rates up to now
in several countries. The risk that the cooling effects
of past monetary tightening are yet to come should be
taken seriously where fixed-rate mortgages have short
fixation periods, especially if households are heavily
indebted. The longer rates are kept high, the greater
the likelihood that households will feel the pinch, even
where they have so far been relatively sheltered.

Introduction
Since late 2021, in a bid to restore price stability,
central banks around the world have raised policy
interest rates at a speed, degree, and breadth unprecedented in at least 40 years. Reopening-related

supply-chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine
hit post-lockdown economies with a series of supply
shocks. These shocks, combined with extraordinarily supportive fiscal and monetary policies during
the pandemic, supercharged inflation to levels not
seen in decades.1 Given the sudden rise in interest rates, many observers predicted a sharp fall in
growth for 2023.
In the end, global growth proved surprisingly
resilient despite higher policy rates. Economic activity outpaced expectations in most countries, and
employment, in particular, remained robust, even as
inflation retreated significantly. Clearly good news,
such as the partial reversal of the earlier supply
shocks, materialized at the same time as rates were
rising (Chapter 1).
What do we know about the macroeconomic
effects of monetary policy, the so-called transmission
of monetary policy, from the academic literature?
First, transmission varies across countries, and macroeconomic effects take time (peak responses are often
estimated to be about two years). Milton Friedman
(1961) famously summarized these lags as being
“long and variable.” Asset prices, including house
prices, respond faster. Second, economists have found
some support for asymmetric effects; that is, rising
policy rates have larger effects than similar-sized
declines. This may be either because unemployment
responds more when rates increase, since—as argued
by John Maynard Keynes (1936)—prices and wages
are not typically adjusted down, or because of credit
constraints, as argued by Ben Bernanke and coauthors
in the 1990s.2
Resilient global growth could suggest that the
historically strong transmission of rising rates has
now weakened. However, in some countries, demand
has in fact cooled noticeably, and households are

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

clearly feeling the pinch of higher rates. Why in those
countries and not others? The diversity of experiences
offers an opportunity to learn about how monetary
policy works.
This chapter investigates the transmission of monetary policy across countries and over time through the
lens of mortgage and housing markets. The so-called
housing channels of monetary policy transmission are
known to be important. Mortgages are the largest liability of households, with housing often households’
only significant form of wealth. Real estate accounts
for a large share of consumption, investment,
employment, and consumer prices in most economies. House prices, as a macrocritical asset price, can
offer early clues as to where households are feeling
the pinch of monetary policy. Finally, mortgage and
housing markets vary significantly across countries,
which helps in assessing the degree of variability in
transmission.
To this end, the chapter addresses four main
questions:
• Where are real estate and mortgage markets now?
How have they evolved following the global financial crisis, the pandemic, and the recent monetary
tightening?
• Conceptually, what are the housing channels of
monetary policy transmission? How are housing
channels tied to mortgage and housing market
characteristics?
• How do the housing channels vary across
countries?
• Have the housing channels weakened in recent
years?
To answer these questions, the chapter offers a
conceptual framework to guide the reader through the
housing channels of monetary policy, linking them to
mortgage and housing market characteristics. It applies
empirical methods to a broader group of countries
than in previous studies. And it does this by leveraging new data: (1) monetary policy surprises against
analyst predictions, to identify exogenous changes in
interest rates, and (2) the prevalence of fixed-rate mortgages across countries, through information collected
from public sources and national authorities. A new
regional data set of house prices and real activity is
also used. Model simulations assess the joint effects
of the prevalence of fixed-rate mortgages and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) limits. The chapter builds

44

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

on earlier IMF work3 and a long academic literature.4
Methods follow Jordà (2005), Stock and Watson
(2018), and Chen and others (2023).
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• Mortgage and real estate markets have undergone
several shifts in the past few decades. At the beginning
of the recent hiking cycle and after a long period of
low interest rates, mortgage interest payments were
historically low, and the average maturity and share
of mortgages subject to fixed rates were high in
many countries. Low rates, together with structural
changes prompted by the pandemic and associated
lockdowns, led to rapid growth in house prices.
Residential real estate prices are still well above
prepandemic levels but have now stabilized and
even declined in some economies in 2023. Country
experiences vary widely.
• The housing channels of monetary policy vary significantly across countries. Mortgage market characteristics matter: the transmission of monetary policy is
stronger in countries where (1) fixed-rate mortgages
(FRMs) are less common, (2) home buyers are more
leveraged on account of less-restrictive regulatory
LTV limits, and (3) household debt is high. Moreover, model simulations suggest that these effects
reinforce each other. Restrictive regulatory LTV limits
and household debt may dampen transmission more
in the short term, delaying transmission. Housing
market characteristics also matter: the transmission
of monetary policy is stronger in countries where
(1) housing supply is more restricted and (2) house

Economic Outlook (WEO), on housing and monetary policy (the
last in-depth coverage of these issues in the WEO); Chapter 3 of the
April 2020 WEO and Chapter 2 of the April 2022 WEO, which
covered debt, macroprudential, and monetary policy; and Deb and
others (2022) on housing issues in Asia. Related issues not covered
in the chapter include commercial real estate in Chapter 3 of the
April 2021 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR); bank lending
channels in Chapter 2 of the October 2016 GFSR; and monetary
policy calibration, covered in Chapter 3 of the October 2009 WEO
and Chapter 2 of the April 2019 GFSR.

and Stracca 2013; Pica 2021; Corsetti, Duarte, and Mann 2022;
Battistini and others 2022); recent findings on regional housing markets, mainly for the United States (Huang and Tang 2012; Aastveit
and Anundsen 2022; Albuquerque, Iseringhausen, and Opitz 2024);
and more generally findings on the housing channels of monetary
policy (Flodén and others 2021; Beraja and others 2019; Bernanke
and Gertler 1995; Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico 2020; Di Maggio
and others 2017; Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante 2020; Kuchler,
Piazzesi, and Stroebel 2023; Mian, Rao, and Sufi 2013). These
findings are cited in this chapter where relevant.

CHAPTER 2

FEELING THE PINCH? TRACING THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY THROUGH HOUSING MARKETS

prices have recently been overvalued. The chapter
finds some evidence that these two housing market characteristics strengthen transmission more
when monetary policy is tightening than when it
is loosening. In the other direction, a high prevalence of FRMs dampens transmission more in a
tightening cycle. Because these characteristics vary
significantly across countries, the effects of monetary
policy vary too.
• The housing channels have weakened in several countries recently. Developments since the global financial
crisis and during the pandemic have weakened the
housing channels in many countries: the prevalence
of fixed-rate mortgages has increased, regulatory LTV
limits have been tightened, and population has shifted
to less-supply-constrained areas. This is counterbalanced in some cases by increases in house prices in
already-overvalued areas and in household debt, which
would strengthen the effects of monetary policy.
The chapter’s analyses are subject to caveats. First, the
empirical analyses are constrained by data availability,
both across economies and over time. This lack of data,
for example, precludes the study of rents. Second, the
chapter focuses narrowly on the role of residential real
estate and household mortgage characteristics, ignoring other channels of transmission. It therefore delves
into whether households bear interest rate risk, while
abstracting from whether banks or governments share
that burden. Third, it is not technically feasible to gather
all characteristics within the same framework, and thus
the analyses may not capture general equilibrium effects.
The chapter begins by documenting trends in mortgage and housing markets. It then offers a conceptual
framework that relates the effects of monetary policy to
mortgage and housing market characteristics. Next, the
chapter provides evidence that the effects of monetary
policy vary significantly across countries because of
those characteristics. The final section assesses whether
the strength of the housing channels has changed over
time and draws lessons for monetary and macroprudential policymakers.

together with the recent divergence of house prices
across countries, may offer clues about the effectiveness
of monetary policy.

Real Estate Markets since the Global Financial Crisis and
during the Pandemic
Postpandemic tightening followed an extended
period of low interest rates (Figure 2.1). In the
immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis,
central banks slashed interest rates globally. Throughout the 2010s, policy rates were kept low and were
brought close to zero in advanced economies amid
weak economic growth and low inflation. In 2020,
the pandemic prompted another round of policy rate
cuts. Major central banks expanded the asset purchase
programs they had initiated in 2008, and other central
banks started new such programs. This helped keep
long-term rates low.
Many households took advantage of low interest
rates to secure low-cost mortgages. Consequently, at
the start of the recent hiking cycle, effective mortgage
rates had reached their lowest point in decades in many
countries.5 In some countries, this was accompanied
5For example, effective mortgage rates in France, Germany, and
the United States reached 1.5, 1.7, and 3.3 percent, respectively, in
early 2022 after declining from 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5 percent in 2011,
respectively.

by a shift to mortgages that allow for a period of
fixed-interest payments, often driven by refinancing of
old loans where that was possible: fixed-rate mortgages
became more common (also see Figure 2.13 and discussion therein) and mortgages long-dated.
Separately, drawing lessons from the global financial crisis, many country authorities tightened macroprudential policies related to housing financing.
This aimed to limit risky lending, which had been a
major contributor to the global financial crisis, fueling
boom-bust cycles in house prices in the mid-2000s in
many countries. At the turn of the 2010s, these efforts
had borne fruit: the average creditworthiness and leverage of households had generally improved.
During the pandemic and associated lockdowns,
the combination of low rates and structural changes
led to rapid growth in house prices globally, adding to
already-elevated prepandemic levels in some countries (Figure 2.2). House prices often grew faster than
income (Online Annex Figure 2.2.2),6 lowering affordability and driving potential buyers to rent instead.
This, combined with falling new construction, boosted
rents in many countries. At the same time, the search
for larger living space meant that in some countries
(for example, the United States), house prices rose
more in suburbs than in high-density urban core areas;
in others (for example, Denmark, France, and the
United Kingdom), prices in locations offering outdoor

activities rose most, likely fueled by an increase in
second-home purchases (Gupta and others 2022;
Biljanovska and Dell’Ariccia 2023; Li and Su 2023).
In parallel, pandemic-era changes in labor practices (such as remote work) created new headwinds
to an already-challenged commercial real estate sector
(Figure 2.3). Price drops, which were pronounced in
the United States for offices, have persisted even since
economies reopened, suggesting that remote work
arrangements and shifts away from brick-and-mortar
retail could linger. Even though these structural changes
are not related to monetary policy, rising borrowing
costs are generating additional strains because preexisting low-rate loans will need refinancing over time.7

Real Estate Markets Offer Clues about the Diverging
Effects of the Recent Tightening
In some ways, real estate markets reacted synchronously to the recent equally synchronous and
broad-based monetary tightening. Rising borrowing
costs cooled building activity in most countries, depressing supply, which was already insufficient following
the global financial crisis (Online Annex Figure 2.2.3),
just as high inflation, particularly in prices for raw

materials, triggered a surge in construction costs (Online
Annex Figure 2.2.5). Meanwhile, elevated rates on
new mortgages contributed to a drying up of housing
transactions in most economies—particularly in those in
which homeowners had locked in mortgages with a low
fixed rate and so were reluctant to sell (see, for example,
Fonseca and Liu 2023 for the United States).
Despite these commonalities, house prices have
evolved very differently across countries amid monetary policy tightening. Since the beginning of the current hiking cycle, nominal house prices have declined
in about a third of countries in the sample considered
here (a rare occurrence) but continued to rise elsewhere (Figure 2.4). Regardless, house prices remained
elevated at the end of 2023 in most countries. Similarly, household consumption has evolved differently
across countries, indicating that some households have
started to feel the pinch of monetary policy, but not
those everywhere. House prices and consumption have
often moved in the same direction, rising in tandem in
some countries (for example, Colombia and Hungary)
and declining in others (for example, Germany and
Sweden). While this diversity is likely driven by factors
beyond monetary policy, it still suggests that a formal
study of housing markets may shed light on the differential effects of monetary policy across countries.

The Housing Channels of Monetary Policy
Transmission
This section discusses conceptually how monetary
policy operates through housing. Figure 2.5 summarizes the housing channels of monetary policy
transmission to household consumption and residential investment, which together represent about
70 percent of GDP in most economies (Online Annex
Figure 2.2.1). The figure is stylized and abstracts from
second-round effects from consumption and investment back to house prices and credit.8
First, through a cash flow channel (channel 1
in Figure 2.5), rising policy rates directly depress
consumption by homeowners with adjustable-rate
mortgages who cannot borrow easily (Di Maggio and
others 2017; Flodén and others 2021).9 The same logic
applies in reverse when policy rates are lowered. The
cash flow channel operates even in countries with high
8For clarity, the figure ignores effects on rents or effects from
unconventional monetary policy. Changes in policy rates can affect
rents through homeownership decisions: if rising mortgage costs
outpace declining home prices, prospective new buyers may decide
to delay buying property and remain in the rental market. Existing
owners may also decide to sell as mortgage costs become prohibitive.
This in turn can pressure rents upward, with negative impacts on
renters’ consumption and positive impacts on residential investment.
In addition, unconventional monetary policy (e.g., quantitative
easing) may affect house prices by shifting investor demand through
a portfolio-rebalancing effect much like that in the expectations/risk
premium channel discussed later in the chapter.
9Although bank earnings may rise in a hiking cycle, this windfall
is not typically spent to offset the fall in homeowners’ consumption.
The observation that rising policy rates directly depress consumption by homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages who cannot borrow easily abstracts from the response of banks. Altunok, Arslan, and
Ongena (2023) find that banks holding adjustable-rate mortgages
benefit from rising policy rates and thus may be more willing to
supply credit relative to banks holding fixed-rate mortgages.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

incidences of fixed-rate mortgages if refinancing is not
costly, but only when rates are lowered. In this case,
refinancing allows households to lower their mortgage
payments and spend more.
Second, rising rates can depress demand for housing
through an expectations/risk premium channel (channel 2).
As is true of any long-term asset, house prices are very
sensitive to changes in interest rates, through evolving
expectations about the future path of monetary policy
and house prices. This in turn affects individual behavior (for example, homeownership decisions, mortgage
choices, and leverage) and hence the macroeconomy
(Kuchler, Piazzesi, and Stroebel 2023). For example,
optimism about future house price growth can be a key
determinant of house price booms (Kaplan, Mitman,
and Violante 2020). Conversely, if households expect
house prices will fall in the future, they tend to reduce
their demand for housing in the present. When the
demand for housing drops, it becomes harder to sell
houses. Lenders respond by raising rates on mortgages to
compensate for the increased risk of accepting less-liquid
collateral. Such a rise in the cost of borrowing further
depresses demand and the price of housing (Favilukis,
Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh 2017).
Third, once rising rates depress house prices, homeowners’ consumption may fall through a wealth channel (channel 3), as home values are often their main
form of wealth (Kaplan, Mitman, and Violante 2020).
These direct effects are strengthened by a collateral
channel (channel 4), because homes serve as collateral
in mortgages (Kiyotaki and Moore 1997; Chapter 3
of the April 2008 World Economic Outlook [WEO];
Iacoviello and Neri 2010; Mian, Rao, and Sufi 2013;
Bhutta and Keys 2016; Beraja and others 2019).
Reduced access to credit because of depressed home
values can in turn lower household consumption.10
Finally, changes in interest rates affect consumption
and investment through credit channels. The demand
for credit responds to changes in mortgage rates
through an interest rate channel (channel 5): when
policy rates rise, mortgage rates also tend to rise (van
Binsbergen and Grotteria 2023), reducing the demand
for credit and housing (Mian and Sufi 2009; Jordà,
Schularick, and Taylor 2015). This is often accompanied by a contraction in the supply and composition of
10Relatedly, a risk-taking channel can amplify the collateral

channel: if banks take on more risk in low-rate environments, when
collateral is more valuable, a sharp repricing of collateral during a
hiking cycle can lead to bank distress, with implications for financial stability.

48

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

credit (Bernanke and Gertler 1995; Chapter 2 of the
October 2016 Global Financial Stability Report), either
through a bank lending channel (channel 6), as a result
of higher funding costs—the interest paid by banks to
savers—or lower deposits, or through a balance sheet
channel (channel 7), if lenders reduce credit to riskier
households, anticipating that the net worth of borrowers will fall and their default risk increase. Borrowers
cut their consumption as a result. Changes to credit
supply can also affect house prices (Mian and Sufi
2018), with knock-on effects on both consumption
and residential investment.
The subsequent sections focus on channels 1
through 5. The same channel may be associated with
multiple mortgage and housing characteristics.11
For example:
• The cash flow channel (channel 1) will be stronger
where households are directly exposed to changes
in mortgage rates, that is, the interest rate channel
(channel 5) is active. This would be the case where
fixed-rate mortgages are rare, where household debt is
higher, or where credit is less restricted by macroprudential policies—that is, where loan-to-value
limits are looser.
• The expectations/risk premium channel (channel 2)
can be stronger in regions where house prices have
risen faster and preexisting overvaluation is greater,
since households’ house price expectations are
known to be backward looking (Kuchler, Piazzesi,
and Stroebel 2023). This effect is reinforced in
regions with larger housing supply restrictions, where
quantities respond less.
• The wealth channel and collateral channel (channels 3
and 4) will also be more pronounced where household debt is higher or loan-to-value limits are looser,
because these factors make it easier for homeowners
to use their houses as collateral against additional
borrowing, including through cash-out refinancing.
Moreover, in places where housing supply restrictions
are higher, prices will tend to react more strongly
to changes in monetary policy. This direct wealth
effect is strengthened by collateral effects, since
11Other characteristics may be relevant. For example, banking

sector characteristics such as competition, regulation, risk management, and size may impact how policy rates transmit to mortgage
rates, and to real activity through the housing channels. In addition,
changes in housing policies such as real estate taxes or rent subsidies
may also matter. Finally, in some countries, the prevalence of
nonresident purchases may affect how monetary policy transmits to
house prices (Chapter 3 of the April 2018 Global Financial Stability
Report). These lie outside the scope of this chapter.

CHAPTER 2

FEELING THE PINCH? TRACING THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY THROUGH HOUSING MARKETS

house prices are more likely to be overvalued in these
regions, and thus households tend to be more leveraged. All the factors discussed also depend on the
degree to which credit demand reacts to monetary
policy—the interest rate channel.
• The interest rate channel (channel 5) will have more
muted effects if regulatory loan-to-value limits are
stricter, because these shift borrowing toward wealthier households, which rely less on debt and thus tend
to respond less to changes in monetary policy.

Housing Channels Vary Significantly
across Countries
To shed light on the housing channels described
in the previous section, this section studies empirically the importance of mortgage and housing market
characteristics using a local projections instrumental
variable framework (Stock and Watson 2018). The
first subsection assesses the importance of mortgage
market characteristics in a country-level panel of
advanced economies and selected emerging markets.
It also combines two characteristics in a model to
assess complementarities. The second subsection uses a
regional data set, with a reduced number of countries,
to assess the importance of housing market characteristics. Both subsections map results back to the conceptual channels and study nominal house prices and real
consumption or income. Differences in characteristics
are not found to affect the transmission to investment.
On the technical side, to address the fact that policy
rates themselves respond to economic activity, both
subsections use newly constructed monetary policy
shocks based on deviations of actual rate decisions from
analysts’ expectations.12

Mortgage Market Characteristics Matter
This subsection applies a local projections instrumental variable framework to a panel of 33 emerging
market and advanced economies13 to study the role of
three mortgage market characteristics in shaping the

shocks cleaned for information effects, following Bauer and Swanson
(2023). Checo, Grigoli, and Sandri (2024) argue that data on these

emerging markets.

of changes in the dependent variable and other macroeconomic outcomes. See Online Annexes 2.4 and 2.5 for details. See Section 2.1.1

transmission of monetary policy: (1) a new measure of
the share of FRMs in the stock of outstanding mortgages,14 (2) regulatory limits on the size of mortgages relative
to home values, or LTV ratios, which constrain leverage
at mortgage origination, and (3) the ratio of household
debt to GDP, a proxy for the relative depth and relevance
of domestic mortgage markets. These characteristics can
be linked to some of the housing channels of monetary
policy transmission as discussed previously.
Mortgage market characteristics vary significantly
across countries (Figure 2.6). Fixed-rate mortgages are
rare or nonexistent in some countries (for example,
Finland and South Africa) but are the majority of
mortgages in others (Belgium, Mexico, and the United
States). At the same time, regulatory LTV limits can
be as restrictive as 45 percent in Korea, whereas in
many countries LTV limits are as high as 100 percent
or more (France, Germany, and the United States).15
14Countries define fixed-rate mortgages differently. To improve comparability, mortgages are deemed fixed rate if nominal payments do not
reset within a year. Creating this new measure involved discussions with
several central banks. See Online Annex Table 2.2.2 for details.
15Other borrower-based measures (like debt-service-to-income or
debt-to-income ratios) are not studied here because granular data on
them are not available, although they may have an impact on credit
and thereby house prices (see Araujo and others 2020; Biljanovska
and others 2023; and Alam and others, forthcoming). LTV limits
are averaged across all mortgage types and constitute an upper limit.
Lenders may impose stricter requirements.

affect consumption depends on whether rates on
existing mortgages adjust to changes in policy rates
50

(Figure 2.7, panels 1 and 2). While there are no significant differences in the transmission of monetary policy to house prices, a high share of FRMs significantly
dampens the transmission of monetary policy to consumption relative to when FRMs are rare, with these
differences becoming significant after five quarters.
The differential effects on consumption reflect
the cash flow channel and are likely driven by a delay
in interest rate pass-through. When most mortgages
have fixed rates, mortgage payments do not adjust as

quickly to a change in monetary policy (Online Annex
Figure 2.5.3). In this situation, many consumers will
not feel the pinch of rising policy rates until the rate
on their mortgage resets. This mechanism will temporarily reduce the strength of the cash flow channel.16
Fixed-Rate Mortgages Matter More When Monetary
Policy Is Tightening
The ability to refinance is critical to understanding
the role of FRMs in the transmission of monetary
policy. When policy rates are lowered, borrowers with
FRMs who are able to refinance may reduce their
monthly mortgage payments. In this case, FRMs will
not limit the transmission of monetary policy as much.
But when policy rates are rising, most borrowers with
FRMs have no incentive to refinance, because they will
prefer to keep their mortgage payments at their lower
fixed rate. Hence, the differential effect of FRMs on
transmission is more relevant when monetary policy is
tightening than when it is loosening (Figure 2.8).17

16This is consistent with findings for the euro area (Calza,

Monacelli, and Stracca 2013; Pica 2021; Corsetti, Duarte,
and Mann 2022).
17See Wong (2019), Berger and others (2021), and Eichenbaum,
Rebelo, and Wong (2022). The magnitudes in Figures 2.7 and 2.8
are not comparable. See Online Annex 2.5 for details.

When regulatory LTV limits are above 100 percent, that is, when they are not restricted,18 both
house prices and private consumption respond more
forcefully to monetary policy. For house prices, the
differential effect of LTV limits becomes significant
over time (Figure 2.7, panel 3). For example, eight
quarters after a 100 basis point increase (decline) in
policy rates, house prices drop (rise) by 1 percentage
point when LTV limits are restricted and by 4 percentage points when LTV limits are not restricted. The
effects of monetary policy on consumption materialize
significantly faster when LTV limits are not restricted,
although these differences dissipate after four quarters
(Figure 2.7, panel 4). This difference by the fourth
quarter is economically large: the effect when LTVs are
restricted is about half of what it is when they are not.
Tighter LTV limits, since they imply larger down
payments, typically more acutely restrict the ability of
poorer households to borrow. Hence, house prices and
consumption may respond more when LTV limits are
not restricted, since the borrower pool includes poorer,
more indebted households, which typically have a
higher marginal propensity to consume. In addition,
leverage may be higher where properties are most
overvalued, making house prices more sensitive to policy
rate changes, consistent with the findings of the next
subsection. Why might the effects on house prices be
stronger than those on consumption? Unless existing
homeowners can use their homes as collateral for loans
to finance nonhousing expenditures (through cash-out
refinancing), developments in house prices are unlikely
to affect aggregate spending.19 Since cash-out refinancing is rare in most countries, the collateral and wealth
channels are likely to be less relevant than the interest rate
channel, which is active at the time of home purchases.
Household Indebtedness Strengthens and Accelerates
Monetary Policy Transmission
Similarly to the results for LTV limits, where
households are more indebted, monetary policy has a
stronger effect on house prices (Figure 2.7, panel 5).
18While LTV limits are measured ex ante, they may not always be
fully exogenous to monetary policy decisions ex post.
19The literature estimates the average propensity to consume out
of changes in housing wealth to be between 5 and 7 percent in the
United States, with the effect driven by a loosening of borrowing
constraints and home equity extraction (Mian, Rao, and Sufi 2013;
Aladangady 2017).

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Eight quarters after a change in monetary policy,
nominal house prices respond about 3 percentage
points more when household debt ratios are above
the sample median relative to when they are below.
In addition, the consumption response to a monetary
policy impulse is significantly faster if debt is higher
(Figure 2.7, panel 6), even if statistically the difference
winds down after three quarters.
Countries with higher household debt tend to be
those where consumers are more dependent on mortgages to purchase a property. Hence, housing transactions are generally more affected by changes in policy
rates, through credit demand and the interest rate channel. Consistent with the effects for LTV limits, monetary
policy seems to have slower pass-through to private consumption, although both reach average effects over the
long term.20 This suggests that ultimately what matters
is the degree to which existing mortgage borrowers are
exposed to interest rate changes, which takes precedence
over the collateral channel and the wealth channel.
LTV Limits and the Prevalence of Fixed-Rate
Mortgages Are Highly Complementary
Up to this point, mortgage market characteristics have
been examined individually for expositional and technical reasons. This subsection uses the two-agent New
Keynesian model with housing and leverage of Chen and
others (2023) to illustrate the joint effects of the share of
fixed-rate mortgages and regulatory LTV limits.
Model simulations suggest that the prevalence of
FRMs and the effects of LTV limits reinforce each
other. Figure 2.9 shows that the transmission of
monetary policy to household consumption is weakest
under more restrictive LTV limits and highly prevalent
FRMs (the blue line in the figure). The complementarity between the two characteristics is seen in the
greater rise in transmission when moving from high
to low FRMs, given loose LTV limits (by 17 percent
from the red to the yellow line) versus tight LTV limits
(by 13 percent from the blue to the green line), and
when moving from loose to tight LTV limits, given
low FRMs (by 23 percent from the green to the yellow
line) versus high FRMs (by 19 percent from the blue
to the red line). The direction and timing of marginal
effects are consistent with the earlier empirical results,
although magnitudes cannot be compared directly.
20Results are similar when the share of households with mortgages
is used as an interaction term (see Online Annex Figure 2.5.1). The
result is also broadly consistent with findings in Corsetti, Duarte,
and Mann (2022).

Housing Market Characteristics Matter
To estimate the sensitivity of monetary policy
transmission to housing market characteristics, which
vary significantly within countries, this section applies
a local projections instrumental variable framework to
a regional cross-country data set. This time, however,
time-country fixed effects are included.21 The first
characteristic, “housing supply restrictions,” reflecting
local regulations that constrain land use or limit the
supply of housing, is proxied by population density
and has been shown to account for most regional variation in house prices in the United States (Saiz 2010).
The second, “house price overvaluation,” is measured
through deviations from the regional long-term
house-price-to-income ratio.22 These characteristics
shed light on the wealth, collateral, and expectations
channels, as discussed conceptually in the section “The
Housing Channels of Monetary Policy Transmission”
and clarified further in the present subsection. Both
housing market characteristics exhibit a right-tailed
21Controls include 12 lags of log differences in the dependent
variable and other macroeconomic outcomes. See Online Annex 2.6
for details.
22Housing overvaluations are computed as deviations from the
long-term house price-to-income ratio. More sophisticated parametric models considering multiple drivers of house prices could provide
more accurate estimates of overvaluation (see, for example, Igan and
Loungani 2012).

distribution (Online Annex Figure 2.6.2), suggesting
that nonlinearities may be important. The outcome
variables studied are nominal house prices and real
GDP per capita, the latter serving as a proxy for
consumption, as a result of data limitations.
Housing Supply Restrictions Strengthen the
Transmission of Monetary Policy
Following a 100 basis point tightening (loosening)
of policy rates, nominal house prices decline (rise) by
an additional 3 percentage points after eight quarters
in areas with restricted housing supply, compared
with areas where supply is less restricted (Figure 2.10,
panels 1 and 2). This effect is 50 percent larger than
the average effect of monetary policy on house prices.
Concurrently, real GDP per capita also undergoes an
additional decline (rise) of 2 percentage points at peak
in supply-restricted regions (about one-third larger
than the corresponding average effects). The effects of
monetary policy in housing-supply-restricted regions
also seem more back-loaded.

Changes in policy rates affect the demand for
housing through the interest rate channel. However,
the same shift in demand and mortgage rates leads
to larger changes in house prices in supply-restricted
regions. This in turn results in decreased private consumption and GDP through both the wealth channel
and the collateral channel.23
Recent House Price Overvaluation Strengthens the
Transmission of Monetary Policy
Similarly, following a tightening (loosening) of policy
rates by 100 basis points, the peak fall (rise) in nominal
house prices is 1.5 percentage points greater in areas
with recent house price overvaluation relative to those
without (Figure 2.10, panels 3 and 4). The effects are
again large, about three-quarters of the average effect
of monetary policy on house prices. At the same time,
real GDP per capita declines (rises) an extra percentage

be more leveraged. Thus, one possible explanation for
this asymmetry is the shape of the leverage distribution: fewer households become borrowing unconstrained after an easing of monetary policy than those
that become more constrained when monetary policy
tightens.25

point in regions with recent house price overvaluation
(about two-thirds of the average effect). The differential
effect is back-loaded for GDP per capita but not for
house prices, which peak at about five quarters.
Sharp rises in house prices are often driven by
overoptimism about future house prices (expectations
channel). These are typically accompanied by excessive
leverage (collateral channel), giving rise to spirals of falling house prices and foreclosures when monetary policy tightens. Income and consumption decline through
the expectations, collateral, and wealth channels.24
Supply Restrictions and Price Overvaluation Matter
More When Monetary Policy Tightens
Furthermore, the analysis suggests that supply constraints and overvalued house prices matter more when
rates are rising, although the lower power of this specification means that symmetry can be rejected only for
house prices and in the first two quarters (Figure 2.11;
Online Annex Figure 2.6.1). Households in areas with
supply constraints, overvalued housing, or both tend to

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

The heat map in Figure 2.12 shows that the degree
of transmission of monetary policy varies significantly
across countries (based on 2022 data or the latest
available). The first three columns focus on mortgage
market characteristics: the share of fixed-rate mortgages, regulatory LTV limits, and household debt.
Meanwhile, the fourth and fifth columns focus on
housing market characteristics: housing supply restrictions and the degree of house price overvaluations.26
Darker reds depict countries with stronger monetary
policy transmission based on the cross-country distribution for each variable, whereas lighter reds indicate
the opposite. Countries with the strongest transmission
are at the top of the figure; those more likely to have
the weakest transmission are at the bottom.
Countries such as Australia and Japan appear to
have stronger housing channels of monetary policy
transmission, with low shares of fixed-rate mortgages, less-restrictive LTV limits, high household
debt (only to some extent Japan), and a somewhat
elevated proportion of the population living in
housing-supply-restricted areas.27 In contrast, countries
such as Colombia, Hungary, and Israel are more likely
to exhibit weaker transmission, with notably low levels
of household debt and of supply constraints.
Important caveats are that columns in the figure
cannot be compared or aggregated for each country
and that the figure focuses solely on housing channels. The relevance of other channels may vary across
countries; for example, the exchange rate channel is a
25See Hedlund and others (2017), Huang and Tang (2012), and
Albuquerque, Iseringhausen, and Opitz (2024) for similar findings.
26Both housing market characteristics are evaluated using
regional data, and neither is indicative of national-level averages
for population density or house price overvaluation. See notes to
Figures 2.12 and 2.14.
27Chile is not mentioned despite being close to the top of Figure
2.12 to account for the fact that mortgage payments in Chile vary
with inflation. Thus, monetary policy transmission to mortgage
payments is likely to be weaker relative to the case in which mortgages adjust to market rates.

(Brandão-Marques and others 2020).
Still, the ranking in the heat map lines up broadly
with actual changes in house prices and real consumption since the start of each country’s most recent
hiking cycle (Figure 2.4), although many other shocks
drive both variables beyond monetary policy. For
example, countries such as Colombia and Hungary
have experienced more significant house price and real
consumption growth since the onset of the monetary
policy tightening cycle. In contrast, in Australia, house
prices declined significantly before recovering recently,
and real consumption has been stagnant.

Housing Channels May Have Weakened in
Many Countries
Complicating the assessment of the strength of the
housing channels of monetary policy is the fact that
mortgage and housing market characteristics themselves change over time, although at a slow pace. This
section documents the evolution over time and across
countries of the previously studied mortgage and housing market characteristics and then draws insights into
how monetary policy transmission may have shifted
by applying the documented changes in mortgage and
housing market characteristics to the estimates from
the previous section.

Shifting Mortgage and Housing Market
Characteristics . . .
Mortgage market characteristics have changed
significantly in some countries since the global financial crisis. Fixed-rate mortgages have become more
prevalent (Figure 2.13), with the increase driven by
low rates, as discussed previously. Regulatory LTV
limits have either tightened or remained stable (Online
Annex Figure 2.2.6). Household debt ratios have
increased in some countries, notably Chile, France,
and Korea, but decreased in others, such as Denmark,
Ireland, and Spain (Online Annex Figure 2.2.7).
Housing markets have also undergone notable
changes, particularly during the pandemic (Online
Annex Figure 2.2.8). In most countries analyzed,
the national-level housing supply is now likely to be
more elastic as a result of migration from densely
populated urban areas to less dense rural or suburban
areas during the pandemic years. Regarding house
price overvaluation, observed changes have been

more balanced. In some countries, areas that were
overvalued in 2019 have seen stagnant or declining
price-to-income ratios (for example, Finland and
Hungary) as people moved away from previously
overvalued regions, contributing to a more even distribution of valuations across regions within a country.
However, in other countries the reverse has happened:
house price overvaluation has risen precisely where
house prices were already overvalued (for example,
Mexico and The Netherlands).

FEELING THE PINCH? TRACING THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY THROUGH HOUSING MARKETS

heat map indicate changes in characteristics that imply
weakening in monetary policy transmission, whereas
shades of red indicate strengthening. Gray represents
no change in transmission. Shades are based on a
country’s position within the cross-country distribution
of changes of the same direction. Countries are listed
in the same order as in Figure 2.12, which shows the
overall strength of transmission—with the strongest
transmission at the top and the weakest at the bottom.
Changes in mortgage market characteristics in
countries such as Canada, Chile, and Japan suggest a
strengthening of the transmission of monetary policy,
driven mainly by a declining or stable share of FRMs,
an increase in debt, and more constrained housing supply. Transmission in Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, and
the United States, however, seems to have weakened,
as characteristics there have moved in the opposite
direction. At the global level, the heat map points to a
decline in the transmission of monetary policy through
the cash flow, wealth, and collateral channels, albeit to
varying degrees across countries. Contributing factors
include increased adoption of fixed-rate mortgages,
tighter LTV limits, lower debt, outmigration from
densely populated areas, and house price deflation in
some previously overvalued areas.
Here, again, the heat map ignores changes in
channels of transmission beyond housing and thus
gives only a partial view of the changing strength of
monetary policy transmission. The fact that policy
rates have been raised over the last two years at a
speed, degree, and breadth that is unprecedented in the
last several decades may have also affected the transmission of monetary policy. Box 2.1 examines another
channel—the interest rate pass-through channel—in
Europe; Box 2.2 discusses the role of real estate in
China’s relatively weak transmission.

Policy Implications
Monetary policy affects economic activity through
housing. The strength of these housing channels
varies significantly across countries and has weakened recently in several economies. These findings
hold implications for macroprudential and monetary
authorities.
First, regarding borrower-based macroprudential
measures, this chapter does not study their effectiveness. A large body of literature establishes that tighter
macroprudential regulation improves financial and
economic stability and therefore should be set with

those objectives in mind. This chapter takes the level
of regulation as given and finds that monetary policy
may have smaller effects in countries with relatively
tight regulation. This is because borrowers are on
average less leveraged and so are not as sensitive to
changing interest rates. This is desirable because it
allows monetary policy to focus on managing aggregate
demand and price pressures and thereby to act more
freely, without fear of precipitating a financial crunch.
Second, turning to monetary policy, the chapter’s
findings suggest that a deep, country-specific understanding of housing channels is important and can
help in calibrating and adjusting policy. In countries
where the housing channels are strong, monitoring housing market developments and changes in
household debt service can help identify early signs
of overtightening. Where monetary policy transmission is weak, more forceful early action can be taken
when signs of overheating and inflationary pressures
first emerge.
But what about now? Most central banks have made
significant progress toward their inflation targets. It
could follow from the discussion that if transmission
is weak, erring on the side of too much tightening is
always less costly. However, overtightening, or leaving
rates higher for longer, could nevertheless be a greater
risk now. While fixed-rate mortgages have indeed
become more common in many countries, fixation
periods are often short. Over time, and as rates on
these mortgages reset, monetary policy transmission
could suddenly turn more effective and thereby depress
consumption. Although central banks already incorporate this possibility in their decisions, the effects
on consumption could still be larger than expected.
Financial instability could also follow if defaults rise
abruptly. This is especially true in countries where
households are highly indebted or where bankruptcy
laws favor borrowers. The sharp rise in house prices
during the pandemic has also rendered some markets
overvalued. These may be more likely to correct if rates
remain high for long, particularly where macroprudential policies did not prevent the buildup of leverage.
With a view to the next tightening cycle, prudential
authorities should add instruments such as caps on
debt-service-to-income ratios, if not already in place, to
prevent such financial stability side effects of monetary policy.
In sum, the longer rates are kept high, the greater
the likelihood that households will feel the pinch, even
where so far they have been relatively sheltered.

In the postpandemic tightening cycle in Europe,
pass-through has been heterogeneous across types
of interest rates (Figure 2.1.1). Pass-through seems
highest to time deposits, followed by that to mortgages
and to loans to nonfinancial corporations. Relative
to past cycles, pass-through in Europe has weakened
somewhat, except for that to nonfinancial corporation
time deposits and loans.
The effects on real activity of mortgage rate
pass-through depend on mortgage market characteristics
such as the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages and the
share of households with mortgages. In some European
countries, pass-through to outstanding mortgages is
high, but the share of households with mortgages is
relatively low. This softens monetary transmission
(top-left quadrant in Figure 2.1.2). In others, strong
pass-through, in combination with a high stock of
mortgages (top-right quadrant), can imply large changes
in household debt-service costs. The annual increase
in mortgage-servicing costs relative to mid-2022 varies
significantly across the euro area (Figure 2.1.3), from
Portugal at 1.2 percent of GDP to Malta at virtually zero.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box 2.2. China’s Monetary Policy and the Housing Market
In China, the transmission from policy rates to the real
economy through the housing market has been weak.
Increasing reliance on interest-rate-based tools could help
improve policy rate transmission to households.
Before the recent downturn in China’s property sector, the country’s housing market exhibited sensitivity
to shifts in short-term interest rates. Lower short-term
borrowing costs were followed by accelerating house
price growth (Figure 2.2.1, panel 1), suggesting an
impact of policy rates on the housing market through
the expectations/risk premium and credit channels.
However, the relationship between house prices and
borrowing costs has weakened since the property sector downturn began in mid-2021, with nonmonetary
factors, including developer distress and large inventories of unfinished homes, playing a more significant
role in housing market dynamics.
Changes in short-term interest rates have a more
muted impact on consumption (Figure 2.2.1, panel 2),
indicating limited transmission through the wealth
and collateral channels. In the past, wealth effects have
been subdued overall, since a preference for homeownership is often associated with higher saving rates,
largely because of the rising burden of house purchases

in a cross-country comparison (Figure 2.6)—further
weaken the sensitivity of consumption to interest rates
through the collateral channel.
In China’s most recent property downturn and
monetary easing cycle, transmission via the cash flow
channel has also been relatively weak. Despite the
prevalence of floating interest rates, existing borrowers have seen limited benefits, because benchmark
reference rates have adjusted only modestly, reflecting
limited use of interest-rate-based policy easing. At the
same time, interest rates on new mortgages—less influenced by short-term interest rates—have noticeably
declined, thanks to relaxed mortgage rate regulations.
This reduction, however, has not benefited existing
mortgage holders given the lack of a well-established
refinancing mechanism.
Recent monetary policy easing, in the form of
multiple rate cuts, has had only a limited impact
on housing-related interest rates. This highlights
problems in policy transmission across the interest
rate structure, which prompted a one-time mortgage rate cut in September 2023. Increasing use of
interest-rate-based tools to ease monetary policy, as
opposed to greater reliance on credit policies, will
help ensure more effective policy transmission via the
housing channel.

SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH: WHAT WILL IT TAKE
TO TURN THE TIDE?

The global economy, while demonstrating remarkable
resilience to recent shocks, faces a sobering reality: its
medium-term growth prospects have consistently been revised
downward since the 2008–09 global financial crisis. This
reflects a downward trend in actual global growth, with the
slowdown starting in the early 2000s in advanced economies and after the crisis in emerging market and developing
economies. This chapter examines the factors behind this
trend, revealing that a significant and broad-based slowdown
in total factor productivity growth accounted for more than
half of the growth decline. This deceleration was driven in
part by increased misallocation of capital and labor across
firms within sectors. A widespread drop in postcrisis private
capital formation and slower working-age-population
growth in major economies exacerbated the slowdown. This
chapter predicts that, without timely policy interventions or
a boost from emerging technologies, global growth will be
only 2.8 percent by the end of the decade, significantly below
its prepandemic (2000–19) average by a gap of 1 percentage point. This highlights the urgent need for policies and
structural reforms that enhance growth by improving capital
and labor allocation to more productive firms, enhancing
labor force participation, and harnessing the potential of
artificial intelligence. Such measures are critical, especially in
light of challenges such as high public debt and geoeconomic
fragmentation, which could further constrain global growth.

Introduction
Since the 2008–09 global financial crisis, forecasters
have persistently lowered their expectations for
growth over the medium term (Figure 3.1). Estimates
of potential output growth—an economy’s maximum noninflationary growth given its resources and
technological capabilities—indicate a similar decline

(Kilic Celik, Kose, and Ohnsorge 2023). This suggests
a possible downshift to a lower-growth regime.
The growth decline implies worsening prospects
for living standards and global poverty reduction. An
entrenched low-growth environment, coupled with high
interest rates, would threaten debt sustainability and
could fuel social tension and hinder the green transition.
Furthermore, expectations of weaker growth may deter
investment in capital and technologies and so, in part,
become self-fulfilling. Therefore, addressing the weakening growth outlook is a policy priority for all economies.
Changes in growth performance can be attributed
to the contributions of labor and capital inputs and
the efficiency of their use—known as total factor
productivity (TFP). Among these proximate drivers,
growth in labor inputs is held back by demographic
pressures and declining labor force participation trends
(Chapter 2 of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook
[WEO]; Goodhart and Pradhan 2020). In addition,
ever since the global financial crisis, anemic private
investment in advanced economies has impeded
capital deepening (Chapter 4 of the April 2015 WEO;
Döttling, Gutiérrez, and Philippon 2017). However, a
comprehensive analysis of business investment dynamics that includes emerging market economies is lacking.
TFP, a prime contributor to trend growth, can
increase through within-firm productivity increases
resulting from technological progress and through
better resource allocation across firms—resources flow
toward more productive firms—improving overall
“allocative efficiency” in an economy (Restuccia and
Rogerson 2008). Whereas technological advances
have attracted extensive research, little attention has
been paid to how allocative efficiency varies over time
and how shifts in allocative efficiency have affected
TFP growth.1 To fill this gap, this chapter employs an
1The contribution of slowing innovation to the decline in TFP
growth has already been studied extensively; see, for example,
Gordon (2016); Bloom and others (2020); Chapter 3 of the October
2021 World Economic Outlook; and Acemoglu, Autor, and Patterson
(2023). In addition, a large body of literature, surveyed in Restuccia
and Rogerson (2017) and including Chapter 2 of the April 2017
Fiscal Monitor, has studied the role of misallocation in explaining
global gaps in productivity levels. Unlike that literature, this chapter
focuses on changes in misallocation over time, their causes, and their
contribution to recent and prospective TFP growth.

approach developed by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) that
proposes that a growing gap in revenue productivity
among firms signals a decline in allocative efficiency
(see Box 3.1 for detailed explanations of the notion
and measurement of allocative efficiency).
In this context, this chapter seeks to answer the
following questions:
• What are the insights from forecasts? How did forecasters’ views on medium-term growth evolve, and
what do they imply about income inequality and
convergence?
• How did we get here? What factors account for the
decline in actual growth over the past two decades?
What role did demographics and private investment
play? To what extent have changes in allocative
efficiency affected productivity growth?
• Where is growth heading? What are the potential
trajectories for medium-term growth given demographic trends and prevailing economic forces, such
as higher debt burdens, geoeconomic fragmentation,
and the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)?
What policies could enable a return to the higher
growth rates seen in the two decades preceding
the pandemic?

66

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

To answer these questions, the chapter begins by
examining medium-term (five-year-ahead) WEO
growth projections, alongside actual growth trends,
over the past three decades across a wide range of economies. Subsequent sections provide in-depth analysis of
the proximate drivers of growth: labor inputs, private
capital formation, and allocative efficiency. Last, the
chapter presents various scenarios to assess the likely
growth paths in the medium term and the potential
effects of policy interventions.
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• The decline in medium-term growth projections
is widespread, reflecting secular forces rather than
forecaster pessimism. Expectations for medium-term
growth have been revised downward across all
income groups and regions, most significantly in
emerging market economies.
• Actual growth has similarly declined, and this is
largely because of TFP growth dynamics. In advanced
economies, productivity growth started to decrease
before the global financial crisis. In contrast, TFP
growth in emerging market and developing economies rose before the crisis and then fell, mirroring
the globalization cycle. For both, changes in TFP
growth have significantly shifted overall economic
growth, accounting for more than half of the decline
in advanced and emerging market economies and
nearly all of the decline in low-income countries.
• Increased misallocation of capital and labor among
firms has exerted a drag on TFP of 0.6 percentage
point a year in the economies considered in the analysis.
This suggests that TFP growth could have been
50 percent higher if misallocation had not increased.
Most of this misallocation increase is because of
uneven firm productivity growth within sectors,
requiring reallocation of capital and labor, which was
impeded by economic frictions. Although shocks
may temporarily worsen misallocation, two-thirds of
it at any time can be attributed to persistent structural frictions, which policy measures can address to
lift productivity.
• Reduced private capital formation since the global
financial crisis in many advanced and emerging
market economies has also contributed to the growth
decline. Deterioration in firms’ valuations relative
to the cost of capital and rising corporate leverage
are the two most important firm-specific factors
contributing to the decline in business investment.
At the macroeconomic level, lackluster growth

performance and uncertainty have inhibited investment in advanced economies.
• Demographic pressures weighing on labor supply are
expected to intensify in the medium term in most
advanced economies and major emerging markets,
contributing to lower global growth. By 2030, global
labor supply growth is projected to be a mere
0.3 percent, less than a third of its average in the
decade before the pandemic.
• Confronted with several structural headwinds, returning global growth to its historical average requires
both strong policy support and harnessing the potential of emerging technologies. Based on projected
demographic trends and conservative assumptions
about technological progress, global growth in the
medium term could fall below 3 percent. Returning to the historical (2000–19) annual growth
average of 3.8 percent requires growth-enhancing
policies and reforms. Their implementation should
aim to improve allocative efficiency and labor
participation and facilitate cross-border trade and
knowledge exchange. These policies and reforms
should also enhance innovation capabilities and
maximize the capacity to benefit from technological
advances such as AI.

Insights from Medium-Term Forecasts
Five-year-ahead WEO growth projections show
a broad-based downturn in growth prospects since
2008 that affects nearly 82 percent of economies,
including the world’s largest (Figure 3.2). Notably,
the five largest emerging market economies—Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, and Russia—contributed
approximately 0.8 percentage point of the 1.8 percentage point drop in projected global growth.
The downshift is evident across different regions
and most pronounced for East Asia and the Pacific
(Figure 3.3).
The dimming growth outlook raises two questions. First, could it be driven by growing pessimism
among forecasters, especially after recent global shocks?
Tracking the average discrepancy between forecast and
realized growth shows no evidence of pessimism bias
(Online Annex Figure 3.1.1).2 The subdued prospects
could in part reflect a correction to previous optimism,
especially since 2012. Second, to what extent does
the dimming outlook reflect secular growth trends?
Forecasters typically consider the medium term the

horizon during which economies close the gap between
actual and potential output. Indeed, the evidence
suggests that WEO medium-term growth forecasts
are generally well aligned with projections of potential
output growth (Online Annex Figure 3.1.2). Deviations have occurred only after crises when forecasters
expected faster growth (relative to potential) to close a
large output gap.
The decline in global growth forecasts may in
part reflect progress in living standards and a subsequent slowdown in growth rates. However, when the
historical pace of income convergence across countries is considered, the catch-up efforts of emerging
market and developing economies explain only about
a quarter of the projected global growth decline since
2008 (see Box 1.1 of the October 2023 WEO). In
addition, the more accelerated decline in growth
prospects in these economies, compared with that
in advanced economies, poses concerns about future
convergence. Using various measures, Box 3.2 suggests
that the pace of convergence in regard to income and
social welfare is slowing or potentially reversing over
the medium term—in stark contrast to prepandemic
historical trends.

World growth accelerated from the early 2000s
until the global financial crisis in 2008 and has
declined ever since (Figure 3.4), aligned with the
dynamics of medium-term projections. This pattern
has been reflected in both emerging market economies and low-income countries, mirroring the ebbs
and flows in globalization that have affected capital
flows and productivity. Advanced economies, however, have experienced declining growth, beginning
in the early 2000s.3 In per capita terms, GDP growth
has followed a similar trend in all country groups,
with a modestly smaller postcrisis decline as population growth has slowed.
For all country groups, these shifts in growth have
primarily been the result of changes in TFP growth.
In advanced economies, annual TFP growth fell
3GDP mismeasurement with expansion of the digital economy
is often mentioned as a potential explanation for the productivity
slowdown, particularly in the United States. The quantitative
relevance of this issue, however, remains an open question. For
instance, Syverson (2017) provides evidence that challenges the
“mismeasurement hypothesis”; Crouzet and Eberly (2021) estimate
that it may account for a significant share of the decline in TFP and,
consequently, GDP growth.

after the pandemic, accounting for half of the GDP
growth reduction. Similarly, in emerging market
economies and low-income countries, TFP growth
dropped from 2.5 percent and 2 percent, respectively,
during 2001–07 to just 0.7 percent and nearly zero,
respectively, after the pandemic. In addition, slower
capital formation after 2008 for advanced economies
and since 2013 for emerging market economies has
also contributed to the global growth slowdown. A
consistent decline in the labor contribution as a result
of an aging population and a related retreat in labor
force participation in major economies have also
played a role.

growth to understand the drivers behind their trends.

A Demographic Drag on the Labor Supply
As a country undergoes a demographic transition,
with declining fertility rates and an aging population,
the share of its working-age population starts to shrink.
Several large economies (Canada, China, United
Kingdom, United States) experienced this turning
point around the time of the global financial crisis
(Online Annex Figure 3.2.1), in line with a noticeable
decline in labor’s contribution to growth (Figure 3.4).
Since 2008, growth in the working-age population (ages 15–64) has slowed in about 92 percent of
the global economy and has been negative in about
44 percent (Figure 3.5). The slowdown is visible in
most advanced and emerging market economies,
whereas low-income countries still enjoy a demographic dividend. These demographic shifts have a
direct bearing on global labor supply. Countries with
a current demographic dividend could help support
growth in the global workforce, in which nearly two
in every three new entrants over the medium term will
come from India and sub-Saharan Africa. The global
imbalance in labor supply also hints at the importance
of migrant workers for advanced economies.
As the labor force ages and the share of older
workers increases, aggregate labor force participation
may also suffer, since older workers are less likely to

participate in the labor market. Shift-share analysis helps tease out some effects of aging and gender
disparities in labor force participation on aggregate
participation rates (Figure 3.6). First, aggregate labor
force participation rates declined somewhat significantly between 2008 and 2021 in most world regions,
except Advanced Asia and the Pacific, the Middle
East and North Africa, Europe, and Canada. Second,
the drag on participation from aging is visible in all
advanced economies and China, and to a lesser extent
in Latin America. Third, advanced economies—except
the United States—managed to counter this aging
effect by significantly increasing their within-group
labor force participation, mostly through impressive
gains in female participation and higher participation
of older workers. The decline in average hours worked
in Europe (Astinova and others 2024) may have countered some of these gains. Last, for emerging market
economies and the United States, the decline in male
participation was a drag on aggregate participation.
Although these trends were evident before 2019, the
pandemic shock has exacerbated the drop in participation somewhat, especially in emerging markets. The
initial pandemic shock led to a strong retraction in
participation rates between 2019 and 2020, especially
in China and Latin America, with some recovery in
2021. That noted, participation remained broadly

lower than in 2019, especially in Latin America, where
participation declined about 1.9 percentage points, and
in the United States, where it lost about 1.4 percentage points.4
Besides cyclical and structural factors, policies can
also improve labor participation rates.5 To understand
how policy variations may have contributed to differences across countries, Figure 3.7 shows the estimated
impacts of selected policy changes on the participation
of different gender-age groups.
4More recent data for 2022 for a subset of the economies in
the sample reveal upward revisions for participation rates in Chile,
Colombia, India, and Thailand. In addition, more recent estimates for labor force participation in the United States suggest
some recovery.
5To explain the potential role of policies, the chapter estimates a
country panel regression to investigate how participation rates for
different age and gender groups respond to policies. This exercise
covers only Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, since data on policy variables for
non-OECD countries are lacking (see Online Annex 3.2 for details).
Given the potential endogeneity of the policies, the results of this
exercise should be interpreted as associational and not necessarily causal.

the expected linear path of the business investment index in 2002–08. Shaded area

The estimates suggest that reduced unemployment
benefits and lower labor taxes are associated with
higher participation for men of prime working age.
For women, an expansion in secondary education
enrollment has a positive association with future
participation rates. Similarly, labor market programs
(such as retraining and reskilling) and childcare
programs appear to be supportive. For older workers,
retirement-age reforms and spending on labor market
programs are also associated with higher participation,
which is of particular importance since the population
share of this group is on the rise.

Anemic Private Capital Formation
The second proximate driver of economic growth
is capital formation. In Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development economies, business
investment—the bulk of total investment—tumbled
after 2008, and in 2021 it fell by about 40 percent of
its pre-global-financial-crisis trend (Figure 3.8).
This section starts by examining whether the
slowdown in economic activity since the 2008 global
financial crisis has impeded economy-wide business
investment. It uses “narrative fiscal shocks”—fiscal
policy changes aimed at reducing budget deficits, likely

not responding to economic conditions—as an instrumental variable to analyze the investment-output relationship.6 The results show that for every 1 percentage
point decline in output growth that is not triggered by
a contraction in business investment, there is a corresponding 2 percentage point decrease in investment
growth. This estimated output-investment relationship
is used to calculate the investment shortfall from the
growth slowdown following the global financial crisis.
Comparing with the precrisis trend, Figure 3.8 suggests
that as of 2021, about half of the shortfall in business
investment since 2008 can be linked to weaker economic activity.
This exercise, however, provides only a partial view
of investment determinants. To gain further insights
into constraints on investment, besides economic activity, the chapter explores the characteristics of firms that
reduced their investment.

investment rate—defined as investment divided by
lagged capital stock net of depreciation—aggregated
across the sample economies. Importantly, both investment and capital stock figures account for intangibles, which are crucial for understanding investment
dynamics (see Online Annex 3.2). Consistent with
investment trends in Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries (Figure 3.8),
the figure shows net investment rates in advanced and
emerging market economies declining after 2008.
The chapter uses regression analysis with firm-level
data to shed light on the most important firm- and
macro-level factors determining the investment decline
since 2008 (see Online Annex Table 3.2.5). The findings
align with theoretical expectations: investment rates
increase with a firm’s market value relative to its cost of
capital (“Tobin’s q”), profits, and cash stock but decrease
with higher corporate leverage and the cost of debt.
Figure 3.10 shows that the overall investment rate
has declined, on average, by about 2.3 percentage
points in advanced economies and 2 percentage points

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

in emerging markets. Of that investment decline,
the regression analysis reveals that more than half in
advanced economies and virtually all in emerging
markets can be explained by the determinants included
in the analysis.
Since 2008, Tobin’s q, an indicator of firms’ future
productivity and profitability expectations, has
decreased by 10 to 30 percent on average, contributing to the bulk of the explained decline in investment
in both advanced and emerging market economies
(Figure 3.10). In emerging markets, the 20 percent
average increase in leverage after 2008 is notable as a
factor in the overall fall in investment rates (see Online
Annex Figure 3.2.4).
The decline in GDP growth since 2008 helps
explain the investment decline, even after key
firm-level investment determinants are controlled
for. Rising uncertainty after 2008 makes a smaller
but still significant contribution to the investment
decline in advanced economies. In emerging markets,
increased capital inflows since 2008 have been positive
for investment.

Productivity and the Role of Resource Misallocation
TFP growth has slowed over the past two to three
decades. Previous studies suggest several contributors to
this trend, particularly affecting within-firm productivity. These include waning gains from information and
communication technology (Fernald 2015); declining
business dynamism (Decker and others 2016; Akcigit
and Ates 2021); tighter credit conditions, limiting new
technology investments (Adler and others 2017; Duval,
Hong, and Timmer 2020); and a slower expansion of
cross-border capital flows and trade since 2008.
This section documents the contribution of rising
misallocation of capital and labor to the decline in
TFP growth and draws lessons for medium-term
growth. So-called allocative efficiency measures the
extent to which capital and labor are allocated to
an economy’s most productive firms (see Box 3.1).
A decline in allocative efficiency, whereby resources
become more concentrated in relatively unproductive
firms over a period of time, can reduce TFP growth;
an improvement in allocative efficiency, as resources
move toward more productive firms, will, however,
boost TFP growth.
The approach used here, pioneered by Hsieh and
Klenow (2009) and refined by Bils, Klenow, and
Ruane (2021), finds that allocative efficiency declined

72

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

during 2000–19 in most countries in a sample of
15 advanced and 5 emerging market economies
(Figure 3.11).7 The median country in the sample
experienced an average annual drag on TFP growth of
about 0.9 percentage point from declining allocative
efficiency. For the median advanced economy, this
drag was 0.5 percentage point. Given that the median
advanced economy saw TFP growth of only 0.5 percent during this period, this suggests that increased
misallocation of capital and labor may have halved its
TFP growth. A notable exception is the United States,
7Allocative efficiency measures, approximately, the extent to which

value added per factor input varies across firms in a given sector. If
the variation is large, there are potentially large gains from reallocating capital and labor among firms, and allocative efficiency is low; if
the variation is small, allocative efficiency is high. For each sample
economy, allocative efficiency is computed at the level of 19 broad
sectors, using data from Orbis. The data cover the whole economy,
including both goods- and service-producing sectors, but the analysis
excludes predominantly nonmarket sectors (such as health care, education, and public administration). Sector-level allocative efficiency is
then aggregated using sectors’ shares in whole-economy value added.
See Online Annex 3.2 for details. See G20 (2021) for a discussion
of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on allocative
efficiency in the post-2019 period.

where improvements in allocative efficiency helped
boost annual TFP growth by 0.8 percentage point over
the period.
What explains the decline in allocative efficiency
across a large group of economies? The observed
drag on TFP growth could reflect either decreased
efficiency within sectors or a growing share of
already-misallocated sectors in an economy. Analysis for the 20 economies shows that changing sector
shares in GDP contributed only about 30 percent
of the annual drag on TFP, with the rest attributable to within-sector developments (Figure 3.12).
The shift in sectoral GDP shares is an important
factor for just a few economies—most significantly
for China, for which it contributes 60 percent of
the allocative-efficiency impact on TFP growth. The
reason the sectoral composition of the economy affects
aggregate allocative efficiency is that sectors differ
systematically in the measured extent of their misallocation. Specifically, Figure 3.13 shows that service
sectors display more inefficiency than goods-producing
sectors. This may reflect structural differences between
goods and service sectors or measurement challenges

with regard to productivity and inputs in services.8 As
a result, an economy—such as China’s—experiencing
structural transformation from goods to services will
register a decline in overall allocative efficiency.
A large part of the observed decline in allocative efficiency within sectors can be traced to uneven firm productivity growth during some of the 2000–19 period.
As Figure 3.14 shows, the dispersion of firms’ real productivity in the 20 sample economies rose significantly
leading up to the global financial crisis and, despite
some subsequent reversion, remains elevated. This
aligns with the decline in allocative efficiency, most of
which also occurred in the first decade of the 2000s.
8Several studies have documented this pattern, using firm-level
data for a range of countries, such as Hsieh and Klenow (2009),
Busso, Fazio, and Algazi (2012), Devries and others (2011), Dias,
Marques, and Richmond (2016), and Chapter 2 of the April 2017
Fiscal Monitor. The literature has tended to attribute these patterns
to differences in market structure and firm dynamics in goods and
service sectors. Online Annex 3.2 uses a method proposed by Bils,
Klenow, and Ruane (2021) to show that there is little evidence that
additive measurement error is more prevalent in service sectors than
in goods sectors, but this still leaves room for other types of measurement errors to explain some of the difference.

A widening of the distribution of firms’ real productivity has implications for allocative efficiency.
Ideally, firms with rapidly increasing real productivity
should attract capital and labor from those growing
more slowly, with marginal revenue products kept
equalized. However, firm-level evidence points to
frictions that slow this adjustment process (see Online
Annex Table 3.2.7). This leads to an initial decline in
allocative efficiency, as faster-growing firms operate
with less capital and labor than optimal. Consistently,
sector-level evidence shows that a rise in a sector’s
dispersion of real firm productivity is accompanied by
a decline in its allocative efficiency.
However, this phenomenon is transitory. As time
passes, firms that have improved productivity faster
than the rest can scale up their capital and labor input,
and allocative efficiency once again improves. Yet this
recovery is slow; firm and sector data suggest that it
takes 9–11 years for allocative efficiency to return
halfway to its long-term fundamental level, which
is shaped by sector characteristics and a country’s
economic and institutional environment (see Online
Annex Table 3.2.8). Consequently, evidence from
sector-level analysis shows that recent shifts in the
firm productivity distribution, along with ongoing

structural transformation in some countries, will likely
continue to affect medium-term TFP growth.
The analysis so far implies that the extent of an economy’s overall misallocation has two components at any one
time: a transitory component that reflects an incomplete
adjustment by firms to recent shocks and a longer-lasting,
structural component that reflects the efficiency of
markets and quality of institutions that govern them.
Evidence from firm-level analysis suggests that, for the
economies analyzed, about one-third of measured misallocation is attributable to transitory factors, and two-thirds
has structural roots (see Online Annex 3.2).

the vertical axes and based on the analysis in Online
Annex 3.2), which rises with market entry and competition, trade openness, financial access, and labor
market flexibility. While some of these indicators of
market efficiency and barriers broadly improved during
the 2000–19 period (notably, trade and financial
liberalization), others worsened for some countries in
the sample, with no systematic evidence that changes
in structural policies are behind the observed decline in
allocative efficiency over the past two decades.
However, the large cross-country differences in
structural allocative efficiency suggest that there is
potential to raise TFP growth through reforms. Analysis of the 20 sample economies shows that if countries
whose allocative efficiency is currently lower than
that of the United States were to reduce their gaps in
structural policies by 15 percent over 10 years, it could
boost medium-term TFP growth by 0.7 percentage
point. While historical instances of such significant
policy catch-up are not common, they are not unprecedented, representing an ambitious yet achievable
policy objective.
Improving market efficiency may also make it easier
for firms to adapt to future shocks. Firm data provide
some evidence that the US avoided an overall decline in
allocative efficiency during the 2000–19 period because
resources relocated across firms faster as firms’ productivity dispersion increased. This led to a faster reversal
of the transitory rise in misallocation that has continued to weigh on TFP for most other sample economies.

Where Is Growth Heading?
This chapter’s focus so far has been on analyzing historical trend growth and the factors behind
its decline. New tailwinds and headwinds could yet
further affect growth trajectories. This section shifts
the focus to a forward-looking question: What are
the likely medium-term growth trajectories, and can
annual global growth return to the 3.8 percent average
for 2000–19?

Baseline Scenario
This section assesses the prospects of labor, capital,
and TFP in the medium term, defined as the year
2030, drawing on analyses in earlier sections (projection
methods are detailed in Online Annex 3.3). Specifically,
labor force participation forecasts use a cohort-based
approach, considering life-cycle, generational, and struc-

tural impacts on labor supply. These, along with United
Nations demographic projections, provide estimates of
potential employment growth, with stable employment
rates assumed. Capital growth projections merge WEO
public investment forecasts with this chapter’s estimates
of the medium-term private investment rate. Finally,
TFP growth is projected by assuming that sectoral
allocative efficiency is moving gradually toward its
estimated long-term level and reaching its half-life in
the medium term, whereas efficient TFP growth—net of
misallocation—follows the historical trend.
• By 2030, the annual contribution of labor supply to
global GDP growth is expected to decrease to 0.2 percentage point, only a quarter of its 2000–19 average
contribution. This reflects a modest 0.3 percent
projected growth of potential labor supply in 2030
(Figure 3.16). The slowdown reflects falling participation rates, which dampen the effect of population
growth on labor supply. However, trends in labor
supply vary widely by region. Low-income countries are expected to experience robust 2.1 percent
growth in labor supply, highlighting the need for
job creation to translate this supply growth into
employment. Meanwhile, labor supply in emerging
market economies, excluding China, will grow by

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

When the contributions of the three factors are
summed, the world’s growth rate is projected at
2.8 percent in 2030 under the baseline scenario.
This suggests that global growth could fall even
more, below the current WEO medium-term forecast
(see Chapter 1). This would represent a significant
slowdown relative to the historical (2000–19) annual
average of 3.8 percent.

Alternative Scenarios
What factors could elevate growth or pose emerging risks? This section compares various scenarios
against the baseline medium-term growth projection.

0.9 percent, and in the US by 0.5 percent, whereas
a sharp reduction in participation will cause labor
supply to contract by 0.6 percent in China and by
0.5 percent in the EU.
• Capital’s contribution to growth is expected to be
1.7 percentage points, compared with the 2000–19
average contribution of 2.1 percentage points. Continued high public debt will likely constrain future
public investment in emerging market and developing economies, which accounts for 30 percent of
these countries’ overall capital. Advanced economies
are expected to see a modest increase in public
investment, but its growth impact will be minimal given its small share in overall investment. In
addition, private investment rates are expected to
remain low in both country groups, owing to subdued economic prospects and the anticipated lower
employment and TFP growth.
• The TFP growth contribution is expected to decline to
0.9 percentage point by 2030, down from the 2000–19
average of 1.0 percentage point. The ongoing decrease
in allocative efficiency is expected to slow TFP growth
to a lesser degree. Meanwhile, the growth in efficient
TFP, which reflects the rate of technological progress,
is expected to slow in the baseline scenario, following
its long-term trend. Factors such as the increasing
difficulty of generating new ideas (Bloom and others
2020), slower growth of research employment (Jones
2023), a plateau in educational attainment, and the
slower catch-up process are expected to play a role.
The net effect is a decline in the TFP growth rate
by 0.1 percentage point from its two-decade average
prior to the pandemic. However, major technological advances, particularly in AI, could increase TFP
growth substantially.

Source: IMF staff calculations.
Note: The estimated impact on medium-term growth is presented relative to the
baseline projection for each scenario described in the labels on the horizontal axis.
See Online Annex 3.3. The scenarios include policy interventions—aiming at
increasing labor force participation, supporting AEs’ labor supply through
migration, reducing misallocation, and improving talent allocation in emerging
market and developing economies—and scenarios in which artiﬁcial intelligence
is widely adopted, there is a persistent public debt overhang, and geopolitical
blocs are emerging (“fragmentation”). AEs = advanced economies; AI = artiﬁcial
intelligence; LFPR = labor force participation rate.

These scenarios assess the effects of policy changes
related to labor supply and resource allocation and of
economic tailwinds and headwinds—positive impacts
of AI and negative effects of public debt overhang
and geoeconomic fragmentation. To gauge the feasibility of the policy scenarios, large and ambitious—
but not unprecedented—policy shifts are considered.
Overall, the medium-term growth effects range
from 1.2 percentage points above to 0.8 percentage
point below the baseline (Figure 3.17). Larger effects
are possible if these scenarios occur simultaneously.
However, given high uncertainty surrounding these
estimates, the figures should be viewed as indicative of the potential impacts (see Online Annex 3.3
for details).
• Policies to increase labor force participation: This
scenario assumes that countries increase their labor
force participation rates by 3.2 percentage points,
the median increment in participation if all countries
converged to the best policies. This could increase

CHAPTER 3

SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH: WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO TURN THE TIDE?

labor supply growth by about 0.3 percentage point,
contributing 16 basis points to global growth.
• A migration boost to labor supply in advanced economies: Migrant workers have supported growth
in advanced economies by filling labor gaps. This
scenario assumes higher flows, along with enhanced
labor market integration for migrant workers, that
translates into an increase in labor supply equivalent
to 1 percent of advanced economies’ projected labor
force in 2030. The resulting increase in labor supply
could add 20 basis points to global growth.
• Structural reforms for improving allocative efficiency:
Building on the previous section, this scenario assumes
that countries close 15 percent of their policy gap with
the United States in areas such as product and labor
market policies, trade openness, and financial deepening over the medium term. These structural reforms
are expected to greatly reduce the drag from misallocation and enhance TFP growth by 0.7 percentage
point, which, in turn, could stimulate investment and
add 1.2 percentage points to global growth.
• Improved talent allocation in emerging market and
developing economies: Although gaps in occupation
and earnings between men and women have been
narrowing in advanced economies, they remain
significant elsewhere. Closing these gaps could lead
to substantial productivity gains, especially if jobs
are filled based on innate talent and comparative
advantage, not skewed by social norms, barriers, or
discrimination (Berg and others 2018; Hsieh and
others 2019; Jayachandran 2021). Should talent
allocations in emerging market and developing
economies follow the trend in the United States over
past decades, global growth could be boosted by a
quarter of a percentage point.
• AI technologies: AI technologies stand at the brink
of transforming many aspects of the world economy (Cazzaniga and others 2024). Their impact on
economic growth is highly uncertain but potentially
substantial. Generally, AI’s enhancement of labor
productivity is expected to outweigh its negative
effects on labor demand. Depending on how widely
it is adopted and whether it replaces or augments
workers, the estimated global growth impact varies
from 10 to 80 basis points in the medium term (see
Box 3.3 for more details).
• Legacy of high public debt: Persistent elevated public
debt raises global economic growth concerns, potentially reducing medium-term growth by an estimated
5 to 15 basis points. The projection simulates growth

outcomes in three scenarios—one scenario in which
debt continues to increase with stable public deficits and two debt-stabilization scenarios in which
increased interest payments are offset either by reducing transfers or public investment. The overall impact
is considered moderate because the scenario does not
assume extensive fiscal consolidation aimed at significant debt reduction or additional channels through
which public debt could affect growth (Pattillo, Poirson, and Ricci 2004; Woo and Kumar 2015).
• Geoeconomic fragmentation: The emergence of geoeconomic blocs leading to international trade and
foreign direct investment fragmentation could reduce
capital and knowledge flows significantly and suppress
growth (Chapter 3 of the October 2023 Regional
Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific). The April 2023
WEO provides reasonable scenarios analyzing the
effects of heightened trade barriers. These vary from
limited cases in which a “US bloc” and a “China
bloc” engage in some “friend-shoring,” reducing
growth by 10 basis points, to a more extensive
scenario in which all regions reshore some trade,
potentially lowering medium-term growth by 80 basis
points. A greater loss could result from a reduction
in trade-associated knowledge spillovers (Ahn and
others, forthcoming) and productivity loss, but it is
not accounted for in this simulation.
The scenario impacts underscore a clear message:
regaining historical growth will demand substantial
policy efforts and, possibly, harvesting net positive benefits from AI. Structural reforms to resolve misallocation are key to restoring growth to historical averages.

Conclusions and Policy Recommendations
The chapter’s analysis suggests that the global
economy’s declining actual growth and waning growth
expectations largely reflect persistent headwinds. A
significant slowdown in TFP has emerged as a key factor, with that slowdown driven by increased resource
misallocation and slower growth in efficient TFP. A
shrinking working-age population in major economies,
coupled with lackluster business investment, has also
contributed. For the most part, the implications of
the analysis here are sobering for medium-term global
growth prospects. Absent timely policy interventions
and a boost from emerging technologies, global growth
is likely to remain well below its prepandemic historical average in the medium term.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

How could policies help elevate growth? The chapter’s findings suggest that interventions should focus on
reforms that promote market competition, trade openness, financial accessibility, and labor market flexibility.
These could significantly boost TFP growth by alleviating institutional and financial barriers that impede the
efficient allocation of capital and labor across firms.
Such reforms offer substantial gains for growth and can
be complemented by governance and external sector
reforms (Budina and others 2023). Industrial policies
targeted to specific sectors, if poorly designed, may
impede resource allocation to more productive firms or
sectors (see the April 2024 Fiscal Monitor on industry
policy for innovation).
At the same time, policies designed to facilitate the
flow and integration of migrant workers, alongside
measures to boost labor force participation among older
workers in advanced economies—through retirement
reforms and labor market programs—could mitigate
the increasing demographic pressures on labor supply.
Encouraging the participation of women in emerging
market economies, by expanding education enrollment
and childcare support, could unlock their untapped
potential. These efforts should be complemented by
policies that reduce social barriers and gender discrimination to ensure talent is optimally allocated across jobs.

78

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

Investment in human capital, especially in
low-income developing countries, is essential to
leverage their demographic dividend. In regard to
capital formation, since higher corporate leverage
has held back business investment in emerging
market economies, reforming mechanisms for
restructuring and insolvency and eliminating debt
bias in corporate tax policies can also help support
medium-term growth (Chapter 2 of the April 2022
WEO). To lessen the negative growth impact from
increased geoeconomic fragmentation, it is important to steer clear of damaging unilateral trade and
industrial policies.
The global medium-term prospects are not all doom
and gloom. Resilience amid various shocks (Chapter 1)
and the emerging promise of technologies such as AI
could prove transformative for medium-term global
growth. To fully harness this potential, countries must
strengthen their regulatory frameworks, including
intellectual property protection, and revisit redistributive and other adjustment programs to ensure that the
benefits from AI are shared fairly and widely (Cazzaniga and others 2024). Looking beyond the medium
term, policies geared toward promoting innovation
play a crucial role in defining the path of future
global growth.

CHAPTER 3

SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH: WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO TURN THE TIDE?

Box 3.1. Allocative Efficiency: Concept, Examples, and Measurement
Not only is total factor productivity (TFP) growth
driven by well-known factors such as technological
innovation and novel business practices that enhance
within-firm productivity, it is also propelled by how
well the allocation of capital and labor across firms
reflects their relative productivity—known as “allocative efficiency.” Consider an example of two firms,
one with high and one with low productivity. If too
much capital and labor are tied up in the relatively
unproductive firm, average productivity will be low—a
case of poor allocative efficiency. TFP would rise if
capital and labor moved to the more productive firm,
correcting the initial misallocation.
A variety of frictions can cause capital and labor
to be allocated to the “wrong” firms. Some frictions
may do so only temporarily. In the two-firm example, the productive firm may be looking to expand,
but its search for new workers may take time. In this
case, allocative efficiency may be low for a while but
will rise as the productive firm gradually attracts new
employees from its less-productive competitor. However, other frictions may weigh on allocative efficiency
more permanently. For example, the unproductive
firm may be politically connected and receiving subsidies or tax breaks that allow it to operate on a larger
scale than its profits merit.
Measuring the extent of allocative (in)efficiency
in practice is challenging. One influential approach,
developed by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and used
throughout this chapter, measures it indirectly by
comparing the marginal revenue product of capital
and labor across firms—that is, the additional revenue
that one more unit of capital or labor could earn in
any given firm. If marginal revenue productivity is

high in one firm and low in another, more economic
value would be created by moving resources from the
second firm to the first. This approach tells us that an
economy’s allocative efficiency is improving if marginal
revenue productivity across firms is becoming more
similar and that it is worsening if it is becoming more
dispersed.1
Achieving lasting improvements in allocative efficiency requires tackling the frictions that slow firms’
ability to change their scale of operations as needed or
that permanently favor or penalize some firms irrespective of their productivity. Many studies have identified
the structural sources of these frictions. These include
size-dependent tax, labor, and social insurance policies
(Levy 2018; Ulyssea 2018); informality and corruption (Misch and Saborowski 2018); weak property
rights (Adamopoulos and Restuccia 2020); regional
barriers (Tombe and Zhu 2019); restrictive trade
policies (Khandelwal, Schott, and Wei 2013; Edmond,
Midrigan, and Xu 2015); uneven firm markups (Peters
2020); and financial frictions (Song, Storesletten,
and Zilibotti 2011; Midrigan and Xu 2014; David,
Hopenhayn, and Venkateswaran 2016; Gopinath and
others 2017; Libert 2017). Several country case studies
have highlighted specific policies that successfully
reduce misallocation, such as removing barriers to
international trade (Ha and Kiyota 2016) and reforms
aimed at correcting distortions in credit access (Chen
and Irarrazabal 2015).
1This is related to, but distinct from, an earlier measure of
allocative efficiency developed by Olley and Pakes (1996). Operationalizing the latter requires information on real productivity
(quantity total factor productivity) at the firm level, which is difficult to measure for a large sample of countries and firms. The
approach of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) requires only information
on relative revenue productivity, which is easier to obtain.

Box 3.2. Distributional Implications of Medium-Term Growth Prospects
The medium-term growth slowdown could affect
global income inequality and convergence between
countries. A slower growth environment makes it
challenging for poorer countries to catch up with
those that are richer. Slower GDP growth can also
lead to higher inequality, reducing average welfare.
This box examines the implications in three areas:
between-country convergence, global inequality, and
welfare convergence. Between-country convergence
has been sustained since the global financial crisis.
One way to measure it is to compare countries’ initial
GDP with their subsequent growth. When this rate
is negative, countries with lower levels of income are
growing faster than those with higher levels, implying
convergence. Cross-country convergence took place
during 2008–19 (Figure 3.2.1) and was fastest during
2008–12. However, the rate turned positive after

the pandemic. Current projections point to no convergence over the medium term.
The previous computation does not consider how
the gains from convergence are distributed within a
country, only country averages (“between-country”
inequality). Milanovic (2002) and Chancel and Piketty
(2021) estimate measures of global income distribution
and inequality, the comparison of the income position
of a group of people in one country with those of
other groups in the world. These measures show that
although inequality has decreased since the mid-2000s,
the pandemic reversed some of the gains (Figure 3.2.2;
World Bank 2022). While between-country convergence has driven the reduction in global inequality in
the past two decades, most of this inequality now stems
from differences within countries.1
1Sovereign governments usually engage in policies that affect
within-country inequality. The analysis presented here uses pretax data to focus mainly on changes in inequality derived from
economic trends before government intervention.

CHAPTER 3

SLOWDOWN IN GLOBAL MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH: WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO TURN THE TIDE?

Box 3.2 (continued)
To assess the impact of the medium-term outlook, a
projection for global inequality is created by combining within-country and between-country inequality
projections derived from the World Economic Outlook
(WEO).2 Depending on the measure analyzed, there
is either no or only a modest expected recoupment in
the medium term (Figure 3.2.2). Small within-country
inequality improvements are not sufficient to offset
the expected slowdown in between-country inequality
convergence.
The results use GDP as a proxy for welfare, but this
association could be flawed (Coyle 2017), since it does
not include unpaid household work or the environmental cost of economic growth, for example. Jones and
Klenow (2016) propose a welfare measure, based on
lifetime expected utility, that complements consumption (highly correlated with GDP) with life expectancy,
leisure, and (less) inequality. Welfare growth historically has exceeded GDP growth, driven mostly by life
expectancy improvements (see Box 1.2 of the October
2020 WEO). Across the board, both GDP and welfare
growth are predicted to fall in the postpandemic period
(Figure 3.2.3). Welfare growth is expected to deteriorate
more than GDP growth, driven by stalled dimensions
such as life expectancy and within-country inequality,
leading to welfare divergence between countries.

Box 3.3. The Potential Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Global Productivity and Labor Markets
Artificial intelligence (AI) stands at the forefront
of a transformative wave, often equated with a new
industrial revolution, with the potential to reshape the
global economy. While its profound and far-reaching
economic and social consequences are not yet fully
understood, AI’s impact on the global economy
exhibits a clear dichotomy. On one hand, AI holds
the promise of enhancing productivity. On the other,
it poses a formidable challenge, with the potential to
replace humans in certain jobs and fundamentally alter
the nature of others.
Building on AI’s potential diverse impacts, IMF
staff have advanced a nuanced framework to assess
AI’s influence on productivity and the labor market.
This approach, based on the concept of AI “exposure”
(Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021, 2023), is extended by
the AI complementarity concept (Pizzinelli and others
2023), which delivers new insights into the likelihood
of jobs’ either benefiting from AI or being at risk.
There is significant disparity in AI exposure between
country groups—approximately 60 percent of jobs
in advanced economies are susceptible to changes as
a result of AI, compared with 40 percent in emerging market economies and 26 percent in low-income
countries (Figure 3.3.1; Cazzaniga and others 2024).
In advanced economies, AI is expected to enhance
productivity in half of these exposed jobs, signaling a
positive impact. For the other half, AI integration could
automate tasks, potentially reducing labor demand and
wages and even leading to job obsolescence. In contrast,
emerging market and developing economies are less
likely to experience immediate disruption but may also
see fewer benefits from AI. Many lack the necessary
infrastructure and skilled workforce to effectively leverage AI technology, raising concerns that, over time, AI
could exacerbate inequality across countries.
A model-based analysis gauges AI’s potential impact
on productivity. In this model, AI affects productivity
through three critical channels: labor displacement, AI
complementarity with skills, and productivity gains.
First, AI adoption may shift tasks from humans to
AI-driven systems, enhancing the efficiency of task
completion. Second, AI integration could benefit
tasks that are highly complementary with AI. Third,
AI adoption may lead to broad-based productivity
gains, boosting investment and increasing overall labor
demand. The model is calibrated to the United KingThe author of this box is Marina M. Tavares.

dom, a country highly exposed to AI adoption and for
which data on households’ asset holdings are available.
The impact of AI on productivity is analyzed
through two scenarios. In the first (high complementarity), AI significantly enhances roles with
strong complementarity. The second scenario
(high complementarity and high productivity) expands
this complementarity by having AI also boost overall
productivity, enhancing the high-complementarity role
(see Rockall, Pizzinelli, and Tavares 2024 on the modeling analysis and Cazzaniga and others 2024 for more
information about the distributional implications.)
In the first scenario, AI use leads output to increase
by almost 10 percent as the UK economy adjusts to
the new steady state through a combination of capital
deepening and a small increase in total factor productivity (Figure 3.3.2). In the second scenario, when
the productivity impact is also considered, output
expands by 16 percent and total factor productivity
increases by almost 4 percent. These gains take place
primarily in the first decade of transition. Incomes

for all workers increase, ranging from 2 percent
for low-income workers to almost 14 percent for
high-income workers, leading to higher income
inequality.
Productivity gains from AI are expected to range
from 0.9 to 1.5 percent a year, thanks to the United
Kingdom’s robust digital infrastructure, skilled
labor force, innovation ecosystem, and regulatory
framework. Conversely, many emerging market and
developing economies lag in AI preparedness, with
potential gains less than half those estimated for the
United Kingdom. This disparity stems largely from a
smaller proportion of workers in high-exposure and
high-complementarity occupations. While in advanced
economies these roles are occupied by 27 percent of
workers, this drops to 16 percent in emerging markets
and 8 percent in low-income countries. This variance
in the initial distribution of workers across occupations
reveals their reduced potential for AI benefits.
For the global economy, the estimates suggest that
AI could boost productivity gains by 0.1 percent to
0.8 percent annually over a decade. However, uneven
distribution of these gains across regions underscores the
need for international cooperation to improve AI readiness and integration in less-prepared nations. Initiatives
along these lines can help reduce global inequalities,
ensuring that AI benefits reach a wider array of nations.

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

After more than two decades of impressive growth—
averaging almost 6 percent a year—the emerging
markets of the Group of Twenty (G20) now account for
about 30 percent of global economic activity and about
one quarter of global trade. At the same time, these
economies have become increasingly systemic through
their integration into global value chains (GVCs), with
the potential to move global markets. This implies that
spillovers to growth from shocks originating in these
economies—as well as from their structural slowdown
over the past decade—can have far greater ramifications for global activity. Since 2000, spillovers from
domestic shocks in G20 emerging markets—particularly
China—have increased and are now comparable
in size to those from shocks in advanced economies.
Shocks in G20 emerging markets can explain as much
as 10 percent of output variation after three years in
other emerging markets and 5 percent in advanced
economies. Trade, notably through GVCs, is a key
propagation channel that has strengthened over time.
Firms more dependent on demand from G20 emerging markets experience higher revenue growth after an
unexpected increase in G20 emerging market growth,
whereas downstream spillovers can reduce firm revenues in countries more exposed to import competition. In response to a negative productivity shock in
GVC-intensive sectors in G20 emerging markets, most
sectors across emerging market and developing economies tend to contract, especially in Asia, whereas many
manufacturing sectors expand, mostly in advanced
economies. Looking ahead, simulations suggest that a
plausible growth acceleration in G20 emerging markets,

even excluding China, could support global growth over
the medium term and spill over to other countries. The
task for policymakers in recipient economies—whether
advanced or not—is to maintain sufficient buffers and
strengthen policy frameworks to manage the possibility of larger shocks from G20 emerging markets.

Introduction
Economic growth in the 10 emerging markets of
the Group of Twenty (G20) has consistently outperformed that of advanced economies over the past two
decades. As their share of world GDP has more than
doubled since 2000, Argentina, Brazil, China, India,
Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
and Türkiye (henceforth “G20 EMs”) have continued to integrate into the global economy—notably
through trade and global value chains (GVCs). Not
only has this helped provide global momentum for
growth and trade, it has also been a force for lower
output volatility—thanks to cross-country diversification—and convergence in income and living
standards (Caselli and others 2020; Patel, Sandefur,
and Subramanian 2021).
However, fading growth prospects for G20
EMs have driven more than half of the 1.9 percentage point slowdown in medium-term global
growth since the global financial crisis, with China
accounting for about 40 percent (see Chapter 1 of
the October 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO]
and Kose and Ohnsorge 2023). The medium-term
growth outlook for G20 EMs has weakened by
0.8 percentage point to 3.7 percent as a result
of scars from the pandemic and the price shocks
that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Figure 4.1). While Chapter 3 focuses on the drivers
of the weak growth outlook, this chapter considers
its potential cross-border effects.
With their stronger global presence and greater
connectivity, the subdued outlook for G20 EMs
risks spilling over and setting back growth and
development across other emerging market and

developing economies. Indeed, the likelihood of
spillovers has increased as the correlation between
domestic (idiosyncratic) growth surprises in
advanced economies and those in G20 EMs has
strengthened over the past decade (Figure 4.2).1
Despite important differences across countries,
evidence that emerging markets are clear sources
of international spillovers is also growing (Cashin,
Mohaddes, and Raissi 2017; Arezki and Liu 2020;
Huidrom and others 2020).
Therefore, the possibility of large spillovers from
G20 EMs to the global economy presents an important set of issues and questions for policymakers over
the near and long terms:
• Considering the growing influence of G20 EMs, to
what extent can they influence global variables?
• In the short term, how large (and different) are
aggregate growth spillovers from G20 EMs and how
do they compare with those from advanced economies? Which countries generate the largest spillovers, and are those spillovers global or regional?

1Domestic (idiosyncratic) growth surprises are defined as the residual from GDP growth outturns after the previous year’s forecasts are
subtracted and after global factors are controlled for.

• To what extent do domestic shocks originating
in G20 EMs propagate through trade and supply chains and reallocate activity across countries,
sectors, and firms over the longer term? And has this
channel strengthened in recent years?
The chapter proceeds in four parts. It starts with
an overview of the growing global footprint of G20
EMs—building on the results of Chapter 3 of the
2014 Spillover Report—highlighting G20 EMs’ greater
global significance for commodities, investment,
financial flows, and trade (IMF 2014). These are
also the key channels through which shocks from
G20 EMs can propagate to the real economy.2 In
the second part, the chapter provides an empirical assessment of aggregate growth spillovers from
demand and supply shocks in individual G20 EMs in
the near term.
Third, based on the finding that financial integration has been relatively slower than that for trade and
commodities, the chapter examines spillovers from

2While shocks from G20 EMs could also drive prices and infla-

tion, the chapter focuses on spillovers to real economic activity.

CHAPTER 4

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

G20 EMs through the latter channels—taking into
account GVCs—over the medium and longer terms:3
• Firm-level data are used to estimate the effect of
domestic growth surprises in G20 EMs on firm
turnover in trading partners over the near to medium
term. The analysis investigates separately the transmission of shocks conditional on the intensity of a firm’s
dependence on demand from G20 EMs for their
products (output linkages) and its use of intermediate
inputs from G20 EMs (input linkages).
• The longer-term pattern and evolution of spillovers from productivity shocks in G20 EMs is
then explored using a multicountry, multisector
model that allows for tracking of the reallocation of
production across sectors and countries in various
steady-state scenarios. Each scenario is designed
to trace the impact of shocks originating in specific sectors across countries, such as those heavily
integrated into GVCs, and within countries, such as
construction in China, to help our understanding of
longer-term cross-border spillovers.

In addition, these economies are among the largest
producers of key commodities, including those critical for the green transition (for example, Argentina
for lithium and Indonesia for nickel). While China
continues to drive many of these patterns, other
G20 EMs play an important role.
• Deeper integration means that G20 EMs increasingly resemble advanced economies and are no
longer simply on the receiving end of global shocks.
Their output fluctuations have become less volatile,
driven to a greater extent by domestic shocks, and—
in the case of some countries—can also influence
global prices. Their growth spillovers not only have
increased but can also explain almost 5 percent of
GDP variation in advanced economies. Furthermore, growth spillovers from some G20 EMs have
reached magnitudes similar to those from advanced
economies. Spillovers are largest from China, whose
domestic shocks can explain about 10 percent of the
variation in GDP in other emerging markets. Other
G20 EMs have significant regional spillovers. Examples are those from Russia, in both the Middle East
and Europe, and from Mexico in Latin America.
• Domestic growth shocks from G20 EMs propagate
through GVCs and can generate winners and losers
through sectoral reallocation. Following a positive
shock, firms with greater dependence on demand
from G20 EMs (for example, China and India),
especially if located in emerging markets, tend to
experience faster revenue growth than other firms.
However, spillovers tend to be negative for firms
that rely more on inputs supplied by G20 EMs.
This suggests that positive growth surprises in G20
EMs such as China and Mexico could be associated
with an expansion of competing production, which
could displace existing activity in trading partners.
• Over the long term, negative productivity shocks
in G20 EMs tend to give rise to negative global
spillovers through the trade channel but can also
generate some positive spillovers for some sectors
and economies. And these spillovers have increased
almost threefold since the early 2000s. In a scenario
in which all G20 EMs experience a productivity
growth slowdown, Asia is the hardest-hit region, with
the intensity driven by its strong links to China. A
scenario in which productivity shocks are concentrated in GVC-intensive sectors highlights substantial
variation in spillovers across sectors: while most
shrink—particularly those in Asia—many manufacturing sectors (for example, electronics and textiles)

Fourth, motivated by weak growth prospects in
China, a model-based simulation is used to assess
whether positive growth surprises in other G20
EMs—and the associated spillovers—can help support
global growth.
The main conclusions of the chapter are as follows:
• G20 EMs have indeed become more important
for global economic activity. Their global trade
and investment footprint has almost doubled since
the early 2000s, while global financial integration
continues to increase. G20 EM consumers and firms
make up a growing share of global demand, and
firms in G20 EMs (for example, China, India, and
Russia) supply a larger share of total inputs globally.
3The 2014 Spillover Report includes a detailed discussion of the
trade, commodities, and financial channels in the context of emerging markets and shows that, although spillovers transmit mostly
through trade linkages, they can also have sizable effects through
financial linkages, including those through banks. Chapter 2 of the
April 2016 Global Financial Stability Report documents (1) how
the rise in financial market integration of emerging markets has
strengthened international spillovers and (2) the growing importance of financial factors relative to trade linkages. More recently,
Arezki and Liu (2020) confirm the importance of financial linkages
for spillovers from emerging markets. Other channels, such as
migration, can also make a difference. For example, the emigration
of high-skilled labor from G20 EMs can have implications for
labor supply, productivity, and innovation in recipient countries
(Bosetti, Cattaneo, and Verdolini 2015; World Bank 2018; Bahar,
Choudhury, and Rapoport 2020).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

expand as economies take advantage of the decrease
in supply from G20 EMs. In terms of employment,
a positive shock from G20 EMs can lead to job
losses for some sectors through increased competition, whereas spillovers that propagate through
sectors connected through GVCs tend to generate
complementarities and more job opportunities.
Comparison of shock transmission before and after
2000 shows that spillovers have grown, underlining
the increased importance of G20 EMs as a result of
GVC integration.
• Looking forward, a plausible growth acceleration
in individual G20 EMs (excluding China) could
generate spillovers to advanced economies and other
emerging market and developing economies, which
would support global growth.
What is clear is that G20 EMs as a group—beyond
China alone—have emerged as an important source
of global and regional spillovers, which are only set
to grow as these economies continue to integrate
further into finance and trade. For this reason,
policymakers must remain cognizant of the impact
a slowdown in these economies could have on firms
and sectors within their borders. As a result, countries with strong linkages to these economies should
build appropriate buffers and policy frameworks to
insure against the transmission of negative shocks
and potential external risks. Given the degree of
reallocation in activity across sectors in response
to G20 EM shocks—notably in countries that are
more heavily integrated through trade and GVCs—
policymakers should consider diversifying output and
input linkages and pursue domestic structural policies
to avoid large-scale dislocation of production factors
and promote efficient reallocation of those factors.
They should also refrain from adopting protectionist
policies that are detrimental to the domestic economy and can generate negative cross-border spillovers (Box 4.1).

G20 Emerging Markets in the Global Economy
China’s accession to the World Trade Organization
in December 2001 represents a critical turning point
for G20 EM integration into the global economy.
Since then, the G20 EM share of global trade has
increased almost two-thirds faster than that of
trade among other countries (Figure 4.3, panel 1),

20 22

promoting global trade and country-wide diversification. In addition, in the two decades since accession,
the share of G20 EM goods imports and exports in
total goods trade has doubled (Figure 4.3, panel 2),
whereas foreign direct investment (FDI) from G20
EMs increased from about 6 percent of total FDI in

CHAPTER 4

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

2005 to about 10 percent just before the pandemic
(Figure 4.3, panel 3).4
Since 2018, the shares of trade and investment flows
to advanced economies and to other emerging market
and developing economies have diverged. Whereas flows
to advanced economies have declined relative to the
global average, flows to emerging market and developing economies have accelerated, which in part reflects
stronger investment ties fostered through the Belt and
Road Initiative (Baniya, Rocha, and Ruta 2020; De
Soyres, Mulabdic, and Ruta 2020). This divergence
has also coincided with the beginning of US-China
trade tensions and has been reinforced by increasing
geopolitical tensions (see Chapter 4 of the April 2023
WEO) as the largest economies have realigned trade
and investment linkages through “friend-shoring” and
near-shoring (Alfaro and Chor 2023; Freund and others
2023; Gopinath and others 2024).
Stronger participation in global trade is mirrored in
increasing financial integration via bank flows and, to
a lesser extent, portfolio flows, even though the overall
scale remains smaller than that of trade. Lending from
banks in the Group of Five (G5) major industrial economies (France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, United
States) to G20 EMs has nearly doubled since the early
2000s, peaking at more than 2.5 percent of G5 economies’ GDP in 2014 and then gradually declining. Lending to China has driven the increase, followed by that to
Brazil and India (Figure 4.4, panel 1). For comparison,
goods trade with G20 EMs accounted for 8.1 percent
of the total GDP of the G5 economies in 2022. These
financial flows are consistent with the more general
observation that private capital has been flowing downstream to economies with stronger growth performance,
as originally shown by Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013)
and Alfaro, Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych (2014)
(Box 4.2). On the flip side, G20-EM-headquartered
banks’ cross-border lending to advanced economies is relatively limited. For other emerging market and developing economies, however, it accounts for about 20 percent
of total cross-border bank claims in line with recent evidence on the rise of Chinese banks (Cerutti, Casanova,
and Pradhan 2023) and the increase of South-to-South
flows shown by Broner and others (2023) (Figure 4.4,
panel 2). Portfolio flows show that G20 EMs’ liabilities

5The larger role of G20 EMs in driving commodity price volatility
has recently been identified using high-frequency data. Gutierrez,
Turen, and Vicondoa (2024) study the international spillover effects
of a macroeconomic surprise in China, identifying a sizable and
significant dynamic effect on commodity prices.
6Output linkages are defined as the share of global demand from
G20 EM consumers and firms, while input linkages are defined
as the share of total inputs supplied by G20 EM industries. An
important caveat is that these measures capture only direct exposures
to G20 EMs. See Online Annex 4.1.

because portfolio flows from advanced economies to
emerging markets—most notably China—are larger once
flows through low-tax jurisdictions are included (Bertaut,
Bressler, and Curcuru 2019; Bergant, Milesi-Ferretti, and
Schmitz 2023; Coppola and others 2021). On the asset
side, however, G20 EM portfolio flows to the rest of the
world are still limited, although on the rise, at just over
2.5 percent of total cross-border portfolio assets as of
2021 (Figure 4.4, panel 3, right bars).
G20 EMs are global producers of a broad set of
commodities (Figure 4.5, panel 1). Beyond China and
its continued sizable commodity outputs, Russia and
Saudi Arabia are important oil and energy suppliers,
and Brazil is a noteworthy producer of agricultural
commodities and minerals. But G20 EMs have also
played a key role in commodity demand since the
2000s, when rapid growth led to an increase in the
global consumption of energy, food, and metals
(Baffes and others 2018; Fernández, Schmitt-Grohé,
and Uribe 2023). At the same time, G20 EMs have
become producers of minerals that are critical for the
green transition—notably, lithium in Argentina and
nickel in Indonesia. As demand for these commodities is set to rise, G20 EMs are likely to become ever
more integrated into supply chains and drive greater
commodity price volatility in a fragmented world (see
Chapter 3 of the October 2023 WEO).5
G20 EMs have also expanded their participation in
GVCs both downstream and upstream as a result of their
demand for manufacturing products (output linkages)
and their supply of inputs to other economies (input
linkages). The median country doubled its inputs from
G20 EMs between 2000 and 2021, while demand from
G20 EMs for outputs more than doubled (Figure 4.5,
panel 2).6 Increased trade and GVC integration among
G20 EMs results from unbundling related to declining
transportation, information, and communication costs,
technological progress, and lower barriers to trade and
capital flows, which have allowed emerging markets
to become more vertically integrated in global supply
chains (Baldwin 2013; Amador and Cabral 2016).

contributions of domestic shocks are derived as weighted averages of the sum of
contributions of domestic aggregate demand and supply shocks estimated for
each G20 EM country in country-specific structural vector autoregressions. The
contributions of foreign shocks are derived as residuals. See Figure 4.1 for a list of
G20 EMs. EMs = emerging markets; q-over-q = quarter over quarter.

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

EMs has become less volatile and is converging to levels
in advanced economies (Figure 4.6, panel 1). Second,
the contribution of external shocks to G20 EM GDP
growth has declined over the past two decades—from
about one-half in the years up to the global financial
crisis to about one-third after (Figure 4.6, panel 2).
However, the key question is the extent to which
domestic shocks in G20 EMs can propagate globally,
which is a phenomenon uncharacteristic of small open
economies. Building on the framework of Fernández,
Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2017), this chapter subjects G20 economies to a “small open economy test” to
determine whether domestic fluctuations can influence global variables—the real prices of agricultural,
energy, and metals commodities, as well as a global
financial variable (either the US short-term interest
rate, the US 10-year real rate, the broad dollar, or US
investment-grade corporate spreads). Cyclical movements in all G20 EMs have become more relevant over
time and appear to have influenced at least one global
variable since the global financial crisis. However, only
domestic shocks in China appear to affect all global
variables (Corneli, Ferriani, and Gazzani 2023).

Aggregate Spillovers in the Short Term

How Have G20 EMs Changed?

If some G20 EMs can be viewed as large economies, then their aggregate demand and supply shocks
are likely to have sizable effects at home and abroad
(see Chapter 4 of the April 2014 WEO). To get a
sense of their importance for other economies, a set
of structural and global vector autoregression (VAR)
models estimated between 2001 and 2023 are used
to quantify aggregate global and regional spillovers
over a three-year horizon. In line with the literature,
results suggest that aggregate growth spillovers from
domestic shocks originating in China to other emerging markets and advanced economies are significantly
larger than those coming from other G20 EMs—and
that they have increased. A 1 percentage point demand
(supply) shock in China leads to an increase of about
0.3 (0.15) percentage point in growth after three years
in other emerging markets, with smaller effects in
advanced economies.7 However, shocks in other G20
EMs can propagate to other G20 economies just as

As G20 EMs have become more diversified and integrated into the global economy and strengthened their
policy frameworks, their macroeconomic fluctuations
and vulnerabilities to external shocks have also changed
(see Kose and Prasad 2010 for a discussion up to the
global financial crisis). First, GDP growth across G20

7Additional results are discussed in Online Annex 4.2. The
size of these spillovers and their more limited importance for
advanced economies are within the range estimated in the literature
(Cesa-Bianchi and others 2012; Dizioli and others 2016; Cashin,
Mohaddes, and Raissi 2017; Furceri, Tovar Jalles, and Zdzienicka
2017; Huidrom and others 2020; Ahmed and others 2022;
Copestake and others 2023).

the top 5 percent of linkages, alongside China, whose
manufacturing production is the largest globally and still
highly dependent on external demand (Baldwin 2024)
(Figure 4.5, panel 3). Other countries—such as India
and Russia—also have a significant presence, reflecting
fast growth in manufacturing production (India) and
strong linkages through the supply of energy commodities (Russia).

8Estimates of the contributions of aggregate supply and demand
shocks from G20 EMs to consumer prices confirm the larger role
of China. A negative demand shock equal to 1 percentage point of
GDP reduces inflation by about 0.2 percentage point in emerging
markets and 0.15 percentage point in advanced economies. Box 1.2
illustrates disinflation pressures from a scenario of a prolonged weakness in the Chinese property sector.

they do to advanced economies, and can have sizable
regional spillovers.
Spillovers from China have increased sharply since
2000. Domestic growth shocks in China explain just
under 5 percent of output variation in advanced economies after three years and just over 10 percent of that
in other emerging markets. In relative terms, growth
spillovers from China to emerging markets are broadly
similar in size to those from the United States. By contrast, demand and supply shocks originating in other
G20 EMs account for less than 4 percent of GDP fluctuations in other countries (Figure 4.7, panel 1), and
their spillovers have grown only moderately (for example, Brazil, India, and Mexico) or even declined (Russia). Similar results hold for spillovers to commodity
prices: a 1 percentage point increase in GDP in China
leads to commodity prices that are almost 10 percent
higher after one year and about 5 percent higher after
three years (effects that are not much smaller than
those stemming from US demand shocks), whereas
demand shocks in other G20 EMs do not significantly
move commodity prices (Figure 4.7, panel 2).
Given their relative size, China’s aggregate demand
shocks were the major driver of spillovers from G20
EMs until the mid-2010s (Copestake and others
2023). These shocks could reflect a mix of policy
shocks—such as aggregate demand management,
mostly through public investment—or increased
demand for imports of raw materials in response to
the country’s property boom. China’s aggregate supply
shocks, on the other hand, have been associated with
the expansion of productive capacity, increased export
orientation, and movement up the value chain after
accession to the World Trade Organization (Mano
2016)—and more recently with slowing productivity
and a shrinking labor force.8
Other G20 EMs can also play an important role
in propagating aggregate domestic shocks, both at
the global level—in comparison with other advanced
economies—and regionally, relative to China. Within
the sample of G20 economies, the relative contribution
of G20 EMs in explaining output fluctuations increased
between the 2000s and the 2010s more than that of
G20 advanced economies, such that for an increasing

number of countries the spillovers from G20 advanced
economies and emerging markets (excluding China
and the United States) are now broadly comparable
(Figure 4.7, panel 3). Although most countries are still
predominantly exposed to shocks in advanced economies, some experience more similar exposures, and
others are more affected by shocks in G20 EMs.
Moving to regional spillovers, those from China
generally dominate those from other emerging
markets—especially in Asia—given high intraregional
trade integration—and to a lesser extent in Latin
America (Figure 4.8).9 Of the other G20 EMs, Russia
and, to some extent, Türkiye generate significant
regional spillovers in Europe and central Asia; domestic supply-side shocks in Brazil and Mexico have an
impact on Latin America via strong trade and commodity linkages. Regional spillovers from Russia have
manifested themselves clearly since the invasion of
Ukraine, through disruptions in energy prices (Bachmann and others 2022; Albrizio and others 2022)
and grain markets globally. However, the Russian
economy’s turn more toward Asia will likely shift
the direction of spillovers. Shocks in large emerging
markets—and particularly those in China—have
sizable cross-border implications for economies in
sub-Saharan Africa (Box 4.3) and, more generally, for
low-income countries, which are exposed to emerging markets’ foreign shocks through the commodity
and demand channels (Dabla-Norris, Espinoza, and
Jahan 2015).

Spillovers from Trade and Global Value Chains
In this section, two complementary approaches
are used to move beyond aggregate spillovers to the
transmission of shocks from G20 EM through the
trade channel—including GVCs—and the reallocation of activity across sectors and firms. The first uses
firm-level data and input-output tables to assess how
growth surprises in G20 EMs affect firm revenues over
the medium term, depending on how firms’ input and
output linkages with G20 EMs vary across sectors.

point unexpected increase in GDP growth in G20 EMs
leads to almost half a percentage point higher revenue
growth after one year for these firms, an effect that fades
but remains one-half of the initial level even after five
years (Figure 4.9, panel 1). This effect is about half the
size of similar spillovers from an unanticipated increase
in growth in G20 advanced economies.
This finding holds both for firms headquartered in
advanced economies and for those headquartered in
other emerging markets. However, the impact is higher
for firms in the latter—revenue growth is 0.8 percentage point higher after five years for firms with greater
exposure. Spillovers also increase over time as the
reliance of firms on demand from G20 EMs increases
(Figure 4.5, panel 2). These results are consistent with
a body of evidence suggesting that increasing demand
from China for goods and commodities boosts firm
exports in several regions—see, for instance, Feenstra,
Ma, and Xu (2019) for the United States and Costa,
96

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

Garred, and Pessoa (2016) for Brazil. More generally,
positive spillovers from almost all G20 EMs are large
for firms in export-dependent industries, both on
impact and after three years (Figure 4.9, panel 2).
Turning to downstream spillovers, firms in sectors
dependent on intermediate goods produced in G20
EMs seem overall to be unaffected by domestic growth
surprises in G20 EMs. This finding could be explained
by two opposing transmission channels canceling each
other out. On one hand, firms sourcing intermediate
inputs from G20 EMs could benefit from cheaper
supplies. On the other hand, the same firms may
suffer a loss of sales from increased competition should
firms in the G20 EMs expand downstream into new
products. These negative downstream spillovers could
take time to build and are consistent with import competition effects from lower-wage countries (Bernard,
Jensen, and Schott 2006), a mechanism popularized
by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) in the context of
China and the United States.
While these two channels cannot be identified
separately, findings suggest that for shocks originating
in Indonesia and Türkiye, the cheaper supply channel may dominate (Figure 4.9, panel 2). For shocks
originating in the largest G20 EMs (China, India,
Mexico), the competition channel seems to dominate,
as spillovers turn negative for firms more dependent on
inputs from these EMs, with revenue growth slowing
by about 0.1 percentage point more than for firms in
less exposed sectors. In the case of specific spillovers
from China, the Belt and Road Initiative generated
positive effects for more upstream industries through
higher import demand in China, but it also increased
competition from China in export markets, generating negative spillovers to downstream sectors—those
producing goods close to final demand—especially in
countries geographically closer to China (Bastos 2020).

Tracking the Reallocation of Global Activity at the
Sectoral Level
Moving to the longer term, a multicountry, multisector input-output network model of global trade is used
to assess how sectoral productivity shocks in G20 EMs
can lead to significant changes in activity across sectors
under different scenarios, as well as across economies,
depending on their region and level of income (Huo,
Levchenko, and Pandalai-Nayar, forthcoming; Bonadio
and others 2021, 2023). In the baseline, a negative
shock corresponding to 2.5 percent of TFP hits all
sectors in all G20 EMs—corresponding to a domestic

CHAPTER 4

output decline of about 10 percent. In a second scenario, only sectors in G20 EMs that are integrated into
GVCs are hit by the same TFP shock. Finally, a third
scenario presents a case study in which only one sector
in one G20 EM is shocked—specifically, the construction sector in China.11
In the baseline scenario, global GDP excluding G20
EMs declines by about 0.15 percent, of which about
one-half is attributable to China, followed at a distance
by India, Russia, and Mexico (Figure 4.10, panel 1,
leftmost bar). This is consistent with China’s role as a
manufacturing powerhouse and the advanced economies’ dependence on Chinese manufacturing production (see Baldwin, Freeman, and Theodorakopoulos
2023 on the “hidden exposure” of the United States to
Chinese suppliers), which can make decoupling from
China particularly costly (Felbermayr, Mahlkow, and
Sandkamp 2023). To help benchmark these G20 EM
trade spillovers, the same shocks applied to US productivity yield a global impact excluding the United States
about one-third of this magnitude, slightly smaller
than the impact from the shock to China alone.12
Calibrating the baseline model using trade and
input-output data from 2000 reveals that spillovers in
2018 had become almost three times larger than those
two decades earlier, which confirms that G20 EMs
have indeed gained importance as their share of global
trade has grown (Figure 4.10, panel 1, middle bar).
Spillovers from the United States, in contrast, have
remained broadly similar over time and, if anything,
have diminished slightly (see squares in Figure 4.10,
panel 1). It is worth noting that the spillovers from
the model are smaller than the shorter-term spillovers
reported earlier from aggregate demand and supply
shocks, reflecting the focus of the model on the long
term and the trade channel.13
11All three scenarios consider negative productivity shocks:

negative responses indicate complementarity, while positive responses
indicate competition. As the model used is static, it cannot account
for dynamics, and results should be considered as a comparison of
two steady states.
12Once the domestic impact of the shock and its spillovers
to other G20 EMs are considered, the global decline in GDP is
4 percent, and 3.4 percent of this decline is the result of spillovers
(including those to other G20 EMs). By comparison, the US shock
implies a 1.4 percent decline in global GDP, with spillovers constituting 3.8 percent of the decline.
13See Online Annex 4.4 for details of the calibration of the model.
In the short term, producers and consumers are less able to substitute for the decline in output by G20 EMs, and hence spillovers to
aggregate output are larger. This can be captured qualitatively by
assuming a lower trade elasticity: halving the trade elasticity from
four to two roughly doubles the impact on global GDP outside G20
EMs from the same TFP shocks.

GDP excludes countries shocked in each scenario. GVC = global value chains.

In a second scenario with TFP shocks only to
GVC-intensive sectors in G20 EMs, the impact on
global GDP outside the G20 EMs is about two-thirds
of that in the baseline scenario, despite a domestic
impact on G20 EMs that is about one-third as large
(Figure 4.10, panel 1, rightmost bar). Applying the
same shock to GVC-intensive sectors in the United
States generates even smaller spillovers, relative to
those from shocks in G20 EMs, than in the baseline
scenario, confirming that transmission through GVCs
is particularly relevant for shocks originating in these
large emerging markets.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

economies are significantly affected, as TFP shocks
from China dominate, though India also has a significant role. The rest of the world region—which
includes most low-income developing countries
and makes up about 10 percent of global GDP—
is even more affected. In this case, India plays a
more important role than it does for other regions,
primarily because of shocks to coke and refined
petroleum products and basic metals, reflecting
these industries’ large demand for commodity
exports by economies in the rest of the world
region. Except for those from China, spillovers
from other G20 EMs tend to permeate mostly
regionally—in line with the findings for short-term
aggregate spillovers. Comparing across regions,
European economies tend to be the most insulated,
with the impact driven more by the shock to Russia.
For the Americas, shocks from China are the largest
contributor to the spillovers, but those from Mexico
are also important, particularly in Central and
North America.
The multisector trade model can be exploited further to evaluate the impact of shocks from G20 EMs
on sectors in other economies. This analysis is important for policymakers to understand, as aggregate negative spillovers mask large reallocations across sectors
and economies:
• Under the baseline scenario, most sectors contract—agriculture, mining, utilities, and trade and
services, especially in Asia—as trade slows down
(Figure 4.11, panel 1). On the other hand, most
manufacturing sectors contract less than others (for
example, wood products and nonmetallic mineral
products), while some even expand (for example,
textiles, basic metals, and electrical equipment).
That is, despite the negative aggregate impact,
there is some reallocation of activity between
sectors.
• The degree of reallocation is amplified under the
second scenario, in which the negative supply
shock is concentrated in GVC-intensive sectors.
Indeed, the standard deviation of the changes in
global sectoral value added outside of the G20
EMs increases by nearly one-third, with the
number of sectors expanding increasing from 5 to
15. In this scenario, most manufacturing sectors
expand (for example, textiles, metals, and electronics) as domestic firms take advantage of the
decrease in supply from competing firms in G20
EMs (Figure 4.11, panel 2)—this is consistent with

98

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

the negative downstream spillovers highlighted in
the firm-level analysis.14
Both the decline in the production of basic commodities and the expansion of textiles production in
the second scenario are driven by emerging market
and developing economies, in line with their role in
commodity exports and the findings of Chapter 3 of
the October 2023 WEO. Meanwhile, the expansion of
manufacturing sectors and the decline in services are
concentrated in advanced economies and reflect their
relatively more advanced technologies and larger share
of the global economy (Figure 4.11, panel 2). The
correlation between the change in sectoral value added
and the change in prices shows the role of the price
signal in inducing sectoral reallocation.
Motivated by the protracted weakness of the
Chinese property sector (IMF 2024), the final
scenario focuses on the propagation of a negative
2.5 percent productivity shock to the construction
sector in China, which generates a 6 percent contraction in the value added of that sector and a half percent contraction in other sectors in China’s economy.
Globally, this drives the largest declines in sectoral
value added in the production of energy commodities, particularly in mining, suggestive of upstream
propagation to inputs to the Chinese construction
sector. Consistent with this hypothesis, air and water
transportation also contract. Meanwhile, textiles
production expands significantly, alongside that
of electrical equipment, which points to domestic
downstream linkages in China propagating to other
economies through higher prices in downstream sectors in which China is an important player in GVCs
(Figure 4.11, panel 3).15
14Mano (2016) applies a similar modeling framework to China,
in which the rebalancing from investment toward consumption and
movement along the value chain can have important spillovers and
generate significant sectoral reallocation. An important caveat is that
the results depend on the extent of substitutability and complementarity implied by the calibration of the model. Indeed, halving the
trade elasticity from four to two delivers significantly less short-term
expansion in sectoral value added, along both the intensive and
extensive margins. The sensitivity of results to different parameters is
discussed in Online Annex 4.4.
15Alternative scenarios provide substantially different results. For
instance, a positive shock to India’s information technology sector,
shown in Online Annex 4.4, exhibits significantly less variation in
the sectoral responses, with this smaller variation driven by a large
contraction of the information technology sector outside India,
which is the result of increased competition, whereas all other
sectors expand.

Spillovers to Sectoral Employment
The spillovers to sectoral activity from productivity shocks originating in G20 EMs inevitably have
implications for sectoral employment. In contrast
with the previous subsection, which assessed specific
downside scenarios, this subsection considers spill-

overs from positive sectoral TFP shocks in any G20
economy-sector pair. Where sectoral activity comoves
positively in response to the positive shock in a
particular economy-sector pair, employment will also
increase, while employment declines in those sectors
where activity comoves negatively. Going one step

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

further, it is possible to catalog the economy-sector
pairs in the G20 in which positive productivity shocks
have the largest positive (“complementarity”) or negative (“competition”) employment spillovers on other
economy-sector pairs in the G20 (Table 4.1).16
Overall, positive sectoral productivity shocks in G20
economies tend to increase employment in other foreign sectors along the global value chain while simultaneously displacing jobs in the same sectors abroad.
Manufacturing sectors in G20 EMs—notably
China—remain an important source of positive spillovers for one another, while positive spillovers from
advanced economies to emerging markets in these
sectors are less widespread. For advanced economies,
the largest positive employment spillovers from G20
EMs (mostly China) tend to emanate from computer,
electronic, and optical equipment, as well as textiles.
In addition to these sectors, emerging markets also see
greater job opportunities materializing from positive shocks in basic metals, machinery, and energy
commodities in G20 EMs (predominantly China
and Saudi Arabia). In contrast, positive employment
spillovers between advanced economies are driven by
shocks to both services—financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific, and technical activities
(from the United States)—and manufacturing, such as
motor vehicles (from Germany and the United States).
Turning to negative employment spillovers, services
and higher-tech manufacturing in advanced economies are identified as sectors that are most negatively
exposed to positive shocks in G20 EM sectors, while
agriculture and relatively low-tech manufacturing,
such as textiles, are at the highest risk of job losses in
emerging markets. In both cases, China again emerges
as a key source of spillovers. Positive shocks from
services sectors in advanced economies stand out as
sources of negative spillovers to both income groups
(wholesale and retail trade, from France, Germany, and
the United States) and advanced economies (professional, scientific and technical activities, from the

United States).17 Moving to spillovers from G20 EMs,
the sectors that generate the largest negative employment spillovers for advanced economies are wholesale
and retail trade and machinery and equipment (from
China), while the most influential sectors for emerging
markets are textiles (from China) and agriculture (from
Brazil, China, and Russia).

16This subsection combines the global trade model with employment data and considers data for 19 countries (all G20 economies
excluding Australia), four regional aggregates (Asia and Pacific,
Europe, Middle East and Central Asia, and Western Hemisphere),
and a rest of the world aggregate. Details on the construction of
Table 4.1 are provided in Online Annex 4.4. The results from the
same exercise using data from 2000 are reported, showing a smaller
role for shocks from G20 EMs, consistent with the latter’s increasing
global trade footprint, and with results more concentrated in commodity sectors, consistent with the movement of G20 EMs up the
value chain.

Can the Other G20 Emerging Markets Support
Global Growth?
This final section of the chapter uses simulations
from the IMF’s Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal (GIMF) model to consider the extent to which
spillovers from G20 EMs (excluding China) could
support global and regional growth.18 To investigate
the potential for a G20 EM upside scenario using
the model, a series of positive short-term five-year
aggregate demand and supply shocks—to household
consumption and private investment—is constructed
for each of the G20 EMs excluding China. The size of
the shock is calibrated to capture a plausible upside to
the WEO baseline: specifically, a 30 percent probability that growth in each G20 EM simultaneously could
be higher than in this scenario.19
These positive shocks raise aggregate GDP growth
for the other G20 EMs by 0.7 percentage point over
the WEO forecast horizon, though with substantial
heterogeneity among them. Global growth also accelerates by half a percentage point. About 85 percent is
driven by the size of the shocks, while the remaining
15 percent results from the other G20 EM spillovers

17Wholesale and retail trade (International Standard Industrial
Classification, Revision 4, Code G) includes import and export
activities. The prevalence of wholesale and retail trade among the
most affected sectors in part reflects the significant employment
share of that sector—on average 15 percent of employment.
18The scenario is modeled using a new version of GIMF augmented with an aggregate representation of GVCs. GIMF is similar
to most macro-focused dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models in that the standard trade elasticities imply easy adjustment of
real exchange rates, even in the long term, limiting the movement of
spillovers through trade channels. This version of GIMF with GVCs
includes roundabout production in the GVC sector, which amplifies
the impacts of shocks on trade flows involved in GVCs. For more
details on the model and this scenario, see Online Annex 4.5.
19The size of the shock is specific to the growth distribution of
each emerging market economy, based on the confidence bands for
the G20 economies, as described in Chapter 1 of the April 2023
World Economic Outlook (Box 1.3). For specifics on the methodology
and the model associated with it, the IMF’s G20 model, see Andrle
and Hunt (2020) and Andrle and others (2015).

onto one another, China, and the advanced economies
(Figure 4.12, panel 1).
Spillovers on growth are more than 0.1 percentage
point for the first few years in China (Figure 4.12,
panel 2), whereas in advanced economies they are less
than 0.1 percentage point per year and two-thirds the size
of the impact on growth in China (Figure 4.12, panel 3).
For advanced economies, spillovers originate mostly in
energy exporters and Mexico—because of its strong ties
with the United States. Finally, spillovers between emerging markets are larger and account for 13 percent of their
growth pickup (Figure 4.12, panel 4). As an example,
upside shocks in India play a prominent role through
GVCs and as a source of additional demand.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Stronger global integration, notably through trade
and GVCs, means that domestic shocks in G20 EMs
can drive larger spillovers to the global economy—in

102

some cases now comparable in size to spillovers from
advanced economies—and generate employment
gains and losses through the reallocation of activity
across sectors and economies. Looking forward, deeper
geoeconomic fragmentation, by reshaping trade and
investment flows along geopolitical fault lines (see
Box 1.1 and Gopinath and others 2024), could reduce
cross-country diversification and increase macroeconomic volatility. In addition, stronger trade and
financial linkages within blocs could amplify regional
spillovers from some G20 EMs (China, Russia), while
price volatility for key commodities could increase (see
Chapter 3 of the October 2023 WEO).
The growing importance of spillovers from domestic
shocks in G20 EMs has implications for (1) the design
of sound domestic macroeconomic policies directed
at building buffers over the medium term against
negative spillovers (for advanced and other emerging
market and developing economies) and managing
domestic shocks (for G20 EMs) and (2) multilateral
cooperation and policy coordination.
As policymakers in advanced economies continue to
try to manage the downward drift in inflation without
damaging growth, they should be sensitive to spillovers from G20 EMs, notably those from supply-side
shocks. For emerging market and developing economies,
spillovers can be sizable and could put growth and
income convergence at risk. The need to build buffers
to better manage negative shocks poses pressing policy
challenges in a context still characterized by the scars
of the pandemic and subsequent shocks and by limited
fiscal space, especially in poorer economies. As a source
of larger global and regional spillovers—much like
advanced economies—the emerging markets of the G20
need to continue to strengthen their monetary, fiscal,
and financial frameworks, while assessing their impact
on other economies. Depending on country specificities, priorities could entail strengthening fiscal positions
to provide buffers, reducing current account deficits to
minimize external vulnerabilities, or reducing balance
sheet vulnerabilities to ensure financial stability.
The reallocation across firms and sectors resulting
from shocks in G20 EMs suggests that policymakers
should pursue policies directed at taking advantage
of new opportunities and at mitigating the effects
on sectors and firms that are more exposed to negative spillovers.
• Given the potential for gains in some sectors
from cross-border spillovers, policymakers should
prioritize the design of a well-calibrated package

CHAPTER 4

TRADING PLACES: REAL SPILLOVERS FROM G20 EMERGING MARKETS

of structural reforms to sustain growth, even when
fiscal policy space is limited. These reforms could
cover governance, the external sector, labor markets,
and business regulation, among other areas. Policies
should be targeted to sectors that stand to benefit
most from reallocation. In this context, industrial
policies, including large-scale subsidies or export
restrictions, should be used only amid large market
failures or externalities, as they can deepen fragmentation through adverse cross-border spillovers.
• Policymakers should avoid protectionist measures to
insulate domestic sectors from foreign competition,
as these are likely to trigger retaliation from trading
partners and can generate welfare losses. By contrast,
sectors and firms hit by negative spillovers could be
supported by inclusive policies—including targeted

fiscal support—that facilitate efficient reallocation of
labor across sectors, upgrades in skills, adaptation to
increased competition from emerging markets, and
mitigation of the harmful distributional impact of
the spillovers (see Chapter 2 of the October 2019
WEO). Other structural reforms, such as promoting
competition to prevent increases in market power
or improving access to credit for viable firms, would
also foster reallocation.
The continued rise of G20 EMs also underscores the
need for effective multilateral cooperation and international policy coordination to manage spillovers and
minimize fragmentation risks. Strengthening the global
financial safety net would allow a timely and effective
response to the costs of negative cross-border spillovers.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box 4.1. Industrial Policies in Emerging Markets: Old and New
This box investigates the impact of domestic
subsidies on trade flows to and from G20 EMs. As
governments increasingly resort to industrial policies
to achieve both economic and noneconomic objectives, the number of subsidies has more than tripled
during the past decade. Data from the Global Trade
Alert database—which records policy changes that
are likely to discriminate against foreign firms—
indicate that by 2022, about 6,000 policies entailing
domestic subsidies were in force in G20 EMs alone
(Figure 4.1.1, panel 1).
Subsidies can affect trade patterns by shaping
firm-level productivity and industry-level comparative advantage (for instance, by promoting research
and development in targeted firms or sectors, as
discussed in Chapter 2 of the April 2024 Fiscal
Monitor). Figure 4.1.1 (panels 2 and 3) shows the
effects of domestic subsidies on goods exports using
a difference-in-differences model that compares subsidized and unsubsidized products, before and after a
subsidy’s introduction.
At the intensive margin, exports of subsidized
products grow faster over the course of the eight
years following the introduction of the measure, at
which time changes in exports of these products are
about 10 percent higher than those of other products. At the extensive margin, domestic subsidies
increase the probability of a product being exported
by 3 percentage points relative to that for other
products. While a similar analysis for imports does
not show significant effects, the pro-trade effect of
subsidies is confirmed in a gravity model, in which
subsidies are found to increase international trade
relative to domestic sales.
These results highlight how domestic subsidies in
G20 EMs can alter comparative advantage patterns
and hence affect export dynamics. Because these
measures can have strong trade spillovers, international
cooperation is needed to attenuate the possibility of
a subsidy war through tit-for-tat behavior by others
(Evenett and others 2024).

Ruta. The box draws from Rotunno and Ruta (2024).

This box investigates the determinants behind
the volume and distribution of net capital flows
to emerging markets. The Lucas paradox refers
to the observation that capital does not flow
from capital-rich developed economies to more
capital-poor developing economies in the amount
the neoclassical growth model would predict. This
result could be explained by differences in human
capital as well as capital market imperfections (Lucas
1990), frictions associated with national borders
(Kalemli-Özcan and others 2010), institutional
quality (Alfaro, Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych
2008), and the degree of capital account openness
(Reinhardt, Ricci, and Tressel 2013).
Subsequent research has documented that not
only have capital flows from rich to poor economies
been low, but their allocation across developing
economies is negatively correlated or uncorrelated
with productivity growth—the allocation puzzle, as
defined by Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013). Differences
between public and private flows could explain the
puzzle: sovereign-to-sovereign transactions account
for upstream capital flows, while private capital flows
downstream; that is, it is positively correlated with
countries’ productivity growth (Aguiar and Amador
2011; Alfaro, Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych 2014;
Aguiar 2023).
Revisiting the allocation puzzle for a large sample
of countries between 1980 and 2019 confirms the
lack of a clear pattern between total net capital flows
and growth (Figure 4.2.1, panel 1). However, private
capital flows do exhibit a clear positive correlation
with growth (Figure 4.2.1, panel 2), as predicted
by the neoclassical theory. The allocation puzzle is
therefore driven largely by public flows, which, in
turn, are influenced by net accumulation of reserves by
faster-growing emerging markets.
The positive correlation between private flows and
growth suggests that the increased financial integration
by G20 EMs, as documented in this chapter, will continue to benefit these economies. Overall, capital flows
can bring substantial benefits for countries by allowing

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box 4.3. Spillovers from G20 Emerging Markets to Sub-Saharan Africa
This box focuses on growth spillovers from G20
EMs to sub-Saharan Africa. Trade integration with
G20 EMs has increased substantially over the past two
decades, driven by China’s rising share in the region’s
goods trade (Figure 4.3.1, panel 1). China’s importance for the region is also reflected in its large investment and official lending flows (Horn, Reinhart and
Trebesch 2021; Chen, Fornino, and Rawlings 2024).
However, other G20 EMs are also strongly connected
to sub-Saharan Africa, through trade and foreign direct
investment (Figure 4.3.1, panel 2). While greater integration has spurred robust growth, it has also increased
the region’s exposure to global shocks. For instance,
weak growth prospects in China could impact the
region through lower cross-border investment and
weaker external demand (see Box 1.2 and the October
2023 Regional Economic Outlook: Sub-Saharan Africa).
A global vector autoregression (GVAR) model is
employed to quantify the impact of possible growth
slowdowns in China, other G20 EMs, and South
Africa on sub-Saharan African countries (excluding
South Africa).1 As expected, spillovers from China
dominate, with commodity exporters—notably oil
exporters (for example, Angola, Chad, and Nigeria)—
particularly vulnerable: a 1 percentage point decline in
growth in China leads to an average growth reduction after one year of about 0.3 percentage point
in oil exporters and 0.05 percentage point in other
resource-intensive countries (Figure 4.3.1, panel 3).
The regional impact of a growth shock in South
Africa is comparable to those of other G20 EMs, but
it is largest for non-oil exporters and highly differentiated across countries. Regional spillovers from South
Africa are strongest for members of the Southern
African Customs Union (Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho,
Namibia), up to 0.3 percentage point on average—and
larger than those from China.
The authors of this box are Hany Abdel-Latif and Andrea
F. Presbitero.
1The GVAR model discussed in this box employs annual data
from 1990 to 2022 for 71 countries, including most sub-Saharan
African economies. Countries are linked in the model through a
bilateral trade weight matrix based on 2017–19 averages.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises
eight sections: Assumptions, What’s New,
Data and Conventions, Country Notes,
Classification of Economies, General Features and
Composition of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and
Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions
underlying the estimates and projections for 2024–
25. The second section briefly describes the changes
to the database and statistical tables since the October
2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third
section offers a general description of the data and
the conventions used for calculating country group
composites. The fourth section presents selected
key information for each country. The fifth section
summarizes the classification of economies in the
various groups presented in the WEO, and the sixth
section explains that classification in further detail.
The seventh section provides information on methods
and reporting standards for the member countries’
national account and government finance indicators
included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. Statistical Appendix A is included
here; Statistical Appendix B is available online at
www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO.
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through April 1, 2024. The
figures for 2024–25 are shown with the same degree
of precision as the historical figures solely for convenience; because they are projections, the same degree
of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced
economies are assumed to remain constant at
their average levels measured during January 30,
2024–February 27, 2024. For 2024 and 2025
these assumptions imply average US dollar–special
drawing right conversion rates of 1.329 and 1.331,

US dollar–euro conversion rates1 of 1.078 and
1.073, and yen–US dollar conversion rates of 148.5
and 146.4, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $78.61
a barrel in 2024 and $73.68 a barrel in 2025.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 5.2 percent in 2024 and 4.1 percent in
2025, that for the euro area will average 3.5 percent in
2024 and 2.6 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will
average 0.0 percent in 2024 and 0.1 percent in 2025.
Further it is assumed that the 10-year government bond
yield for the United States will average 4.1 percent in
2024 and 3.7 percent in 2025, that for the euro area
will average 2.5 percent in 2024 and 2.6 percent in
2025, and that for Japan will average 1.0 percent in
2024 and 1.1 percent in 2025.

What’s New
• Ecuador’s fiscal sector projections are excluded from
publication for 2024–29 because of ongoing program discussions.
• Vietnam has been removed from the Low-Income
Developing Countries (LIDCs) group and added to
the Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies (EMMIEs) group.
• For West Bank and Gaza, data for 2022–23 previously
excluded from publication pending methodological
adjustments to statistical series are now included. Projections for 2024–29 are excluded from publication on
account of the unusually high degree of uncertainty.
1In regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31,
1998, the Council of the European Union decided that, effective
January 1, 1999, the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the
euro and currencies of the member countries adopting the euro are
as described in Box 5.4 of the October 1998 WEO. See that box
as well for details on how the conversion rates were established. For
the most recent table of fixed conversion rates, see the Statistical
Appendix of the April 2023 WEO.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented
in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version
of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide, and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM
2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, monetary developments, financial
sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when revised versions of the manuals
are released. However, full concordance with the most
recent versions of the manuals is ultimately dependent
on the provision by national statistical compilers of
revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are
only partly adapted to the most recent versions of these
manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion
to the updated standards will have only a small impact
on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partly adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a number of years.2
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
2Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European

System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each
country adheres.

112

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

staff estimates. While attempts are made to align data
on gross and net debt with the definitions in the
GFSM 2014, as a result of data limitations or specific
country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the formal definitions. Although every effort
is made to ensure the WEO data are relevant and
internationally comparable, differences in both sectoral
and instrument coverage mean that the data are not
universally comparable. As more information becomes
available, changes in either data sources or instrument
coverage can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes substantial. For clarification on the deviations
in sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the
metadata for the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.4 For the aggregation of
inflation in the world and advanced economies (and
subgroups), annual rates are simple percent changes
from the previous years; for the aggregation of inflation in emerging market and developing economies
(and subgroups), annual rates are based on logarithmic
differences.
3Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and commodity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based
on the simple arithmetic average.
4See Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO for a summary of the
revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights as well as “Revised
Purchasing Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update,
Appendix 1.1 of the April 2008 WEO, Box A2 of the April 2004
WEO, Box A1 of the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May
1993 WEO. See also Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power Parity Based Weights for the World Economic
Outlook,” in Staff Studies for the World Economic Outlook (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, December 1993), 106–23.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing-­
power-parity terms are sums of individual country data
after conversion to international dollars in the years
indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors for
the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in
transactions within the area. Unadjusted annual GDP
data are used for the euro area and for the majority of
individual countries, except Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal,
and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted data. For data
prior to 1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European
currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total world or
group exports or imports (in the preceding year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data.
For some countries, the figures for 2023 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government
finance, and balance of payments for each country.

Country Notes
Afghanistan: Data for 2021 and 2022 are reported
for selected indicators, with estimates for fiscal data.
Estimates and projections for 2023–29 are omitted
because of an unusually high degree of uncertainty
given that the IMF has paused its engagement with
the country owing to a lack of clarity within the

international community regarding the recognition
of a government in Afghanistan. Data reported in the
WEO contain a structural break in 2021 owing to
the change from calendar year to solar year; the actual
reported GDP growth rate for solar year 2021 is
–20.7 percent.
Algeria: Total government expenditure and net lending/borrowing include net lending by the government,
which mostly reflects support to the pension system
and other public sector entities.
Argentina: The official national consumer price
index (CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier
periods, CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater
Buenos Aires Area CPI (prior to December 2013); the
national CPI (IPCNu, December 2013 to October
2015); the City of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015
to April 2016); and the Greater Buenos Aires Area
CPI (May 2016 to December 2016). Given limited
comparability of these series because of differences in
geographic coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the WEO does not report average CPI inflation
for 2014–16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015–16.
Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor
market data starting in the fourth quarter of 2015,
and new series became available starting in the second
quarter of 2016.
Bangladesh: Data and forecasts are presented on a
fiscal year basis. However, country group aggregates
that include Bangladesh use calendar year estimates of
real GDP and purchasing-power-parity GDP.
Costa Rica: The central government definition was
expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include 51 public
entities in accordance with Law 9524. Data back to
2019 are adjusted for comparability.
Dominican Republic: The fiscal series have the
following coverage: public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes the central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are
for the central government.
Ecuador: Fiscal sector projections are excluded from
publication for 2024–29 because of ongoing program
discussions.
Eritrea: Data and projections for 2020–29 are
excluded from the database because of constraints in
data reporting.
India: Real GDP growth rates are calculated in
accordance with national accounts with base year
2011/12.

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Iran: Historical figures for nominal GDP in US
dollars are computed using the official exchange rate
up to 2017. From 2018 onward, the NIMA (the country’s domestic Forex Management Integrated System)
exchange rate, rather than the official exchange rate, is
used to convert nominal rial GDP figures into US dollars. The IMF staff assesses that the NIMA rate better
reflects the transaction-value-weighted exchange rate in
the economy over that period of time.
Israel: Projections are subject to heightened uncertainty due to the conflict in Israel and Gaza and thus
may undergo revisions.
Lebanon: Data for 2021–22 are IMF staff estimates
and not provided by the national authorities. Estimates
and projections for 2023–29 are omitted owing to an
unusually high degree of uncertainty.
Sierra Leone: Although the currency was redenominated on July 1, 2022, local currency data are
expressed in the old leone for the April 2024 WEO.
Sri Lanka: Data and projections for 2023–29 are
excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on sovereign debt restructuring.
Sudan: Projections reflect the IMF staff ’s analysis
based on the assumption that the ongoing conflict will
end by mid-2024. Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan
after July 9; data for 2012 and onward pertain to the
current Sudan.
Syria: Data are excluded from 2011 onward because
of the uncertain political situation.
Turkmenistan: Real GDP data are IMF staff estimates compiled in line with international methodologies (SNA), using official estimates and sources as well
as United Nations and World Bank databases. Estimates of and projections for the fiscal balance exclude
receipts from domestic bond issuances as well as privatization operations, in line with the GFSM 2014. The
authorities’ official estimates for fiscal accounts, which
are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies,
include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as
part of government revenues.
Ukraine: Revised national accounts data are available
beginning in 2000 and exclude Crimea and Sevastopol
from 2010 onward.
Uruguay: In December 2020 the authorities began
reporting the national accounts data according to the
SNA 2008, with the base year 2016. The new series
begin in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF
staff ’s best effort to preserve previously reported data
and avoid structural breaks.
Starting in October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension
system received transfers in the context of Law 19,590
114

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

of 2017, which compensates persons affected by the
creation of the country’s mixed pension system. These
funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the
IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data for 2018–22 are
affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 1.0 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.6
percent of GDP in 2020, 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021,
0.1 percent of GDP in 2022, and 0 percent thereafter.
See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further details.5 The
disclaimer about the public pension system applies only
to the revenues and net lending/borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial
public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In Uruguay,
nonfinancial public sector coverage includes the central
government, local government, social security funds,
nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco de Seguros
del Estado. Historical data were also revised accordingly.
Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—which excludes
the central bank—assets and liabilities held by the
nonfinancial public sector for which the counterpart is
the central bank are not netted out in debt figures. In
this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by
the government to the central bank are now part of the
nonfinancial public sector debt.
Venezuela: Projecting the economic outlook,
including assessing past and current economic developments used as the basis for the projections, is rendered
difficult by the lack of discussions with the authorities
(the most recent Article IV consultation took place in
2004), incomplete metadata for limited reported statistics, and difficulties in reconciling reported indicators
with economic developments. The fiscal accounts
include the budgetary central government; social
security; FOGADE (the country’s insurance deposit
institution); and a reduced set of public enterprises,
including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. Following some
methodological upgrades to achieve a more robust
nominal GDP, historical data and indicators expressed
as a percentage of GDP have been revised from 2012
onward. For most indicators, data for 2018–22 are
IMF staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation and
the paucity of reported data mean that the IMF staff ’s
projected macroeconomic indicators should be interpreted with caution. Broad uncertainty surrounds these
projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices are excluded
from all WEO group composites.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

West Bank and Gaza: Projections for 2024–29 are
excluded from publication owing to the unusually high
degree of uncertainty.
Zimbabwe: Authorities have recently finished redenominating their national accounts statistics following
the introduction in 2019 of the Real Time Gross
Settlement dollar, later renamed the Zimbabwe dollar.
The Zimbabwe dollar previously ceased circulating in
2009, and during 2009–19 Zimbabwe operated under
a multicurrency regime with the US dollar as the unit
of account.

Classification of Economies
Summary of the Economy Classification
The economy classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.6 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and has evolved over time. The objective
is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an
overview of the classification, showing the number of
economies in each group by region and summarizing
some key indicators of their relative size (GDP valued
at purchasing power parity, total exports of goods and
services, and population).
Some economies remain outside the classification
and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba
and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are
examples of economies that are not IMF members, and
the IMF therefore does not monitor them.

General Features and Composition of Groups in
the World Economic Outlook Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of
the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup.
Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area
6As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

cover the current members for all years, even though
the membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (155) comprises all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies employed in the WEO are
emerging and developing Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to as “central and
eastern Europe”); Latin America and the Caribbean;
Middle East and Central Asia (which comprises the
regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and
Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan);
and sub-Saharan Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor economies.
Tables D and E show the detailed composition of
emerging market and developing economies in the
regional and analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2018 and 2022.
The financial and income criteria focus on net
creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries (LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as net
debtors when their latest net international investment
position, where available, was less than zero or their
current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest available data) to 2022 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis
of experience with debt servicing.7
7During 2018–22, 39 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2018–22.

The HIPC group comprises the countries that
are or have been considered by the IMF and the
World Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to
reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible
HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short
period of time.8 Many of these countries have already

Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

benefited from debt relief and have graduated from
the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (based on
$2,700 in 2017 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method and updated following new information in
early 2024), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be
widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs are those emerging market and developing economies not classified as LIDCs.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions
and projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget has been announced, projections incorporate
policy measures judged likely to be implemented.
The medium-term fiscal projections are similarly
based on a judgment about policies’ most likely
path. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions
used in regard to some of the advanced economies
follow. (See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online
section of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal
net lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the
available information regarding budget outturn,
budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets
for the federal government; on fiscal measures
announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff
macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data from
the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the fiscal year
(FY)2023/24 budgets published by the Commonwealth government and state/territory governments,
and the IMF staff’s estimates and projections.
1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as
a percentage of potential output. Structural balances are
expressed as a percentage of potential output. The structural
balance is the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of
cyclical output from potential output, corrected for one-time
and other factors, such as asset and commodity prices and
output composition effects. Changes in the structural balance
consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the
impact of fluctuations in interest rates and debt-service costs,
and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing.
The computations of structural balances are based on the IMF
staff ’s estimates of potential GDP and revenue and expenditure
elasticities. (See Annex I of the October 1993 World Economic
Outlook.) Estimates of the output gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. Net debt
is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets corresponding
to debt instruments.

Austria: Fiscal projections are based on the 2024
budget. The Next Generation EU (NGEU) fund
and the latest announcement on fiscal measures
have also been incorporated.
Belgium: Projections are based on the Belgian
Stability Programme 2023–26, the 2024 Budgetary Plan, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections for 2024 reflect current
policies in place.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
from the Government of Canada’s 2023 Fall
Economic Statement and the latest provincial
budget updates. The IMF staff makes some
adjustments to these forecasts, including those
for differences in macroeconomic projections.
The IMF staff ’s forecast also incorporates the
most recent data releases from Statistics Canada’s
National Economic Accounts, including quarterly federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary
outturns.
Chile: Fiscal projections are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff ’s macroeconomic projections.
China: IMF staff fiscal projections incorporate
the 2024 budget as well as estimates of off-budget
financing.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are
aligned with the latest official budget numbers,
adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff ’s
macroeconomic assumptions. Beyond the current
year, the projections incorporate key features of
the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ latest budget. Structural balances are
net of temporary fluctuations in some revenues
(for example, North Sea revenue, pension yield tax
revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19–related one-offs
are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2023 onward are based
on the country’s 2018–24 budget laws, Stability
Programme 2023–27, draft medium-term programming bill, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences in
revenue projections and assumptions on macroeconomic and financial variables.

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box A1 (continued)
Germany: Projections are based on the latest
approved federal budget, draft federal budget (if
applicable), EU Stability Programme, and medium-term budget plan. They also take into account
data updates from the federal statistical office (Destatis) and the Ministry of Finance.
Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in
line with the primary balance definition under the
enhanced surveillance framework for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term
fiscal projections for expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF
staff ’s projections for the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy plans announced in the 2023
and 2024 budgets.
India: Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year;
general government data are thus finalized well
after central government data. IMF and Indian
presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds, net versus gross
recording of revenues in certain minor categories,
and some public sector lending. Starting with
FY2020/21 data, expenditure also includes the
off-budget component of food subsidies, consistent
with the revised treatment of food subsidies in the
budget. The IMF staff adjusts expenditure to take
out payments for previous years’ food subsidies,
which are included as expenditure in budget estimates for FY2020/21.
Indonesia: The IMF staff ’s projections are based
on maintaining a neutral fiscal stance, accompanied
by moderate tax policy and administration reforms,
some expenditure realization, and a gradual increase
in capital spending over the medium term in line
with fiscal space.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2023.
Italy: The IMF staff ’s estimates and projections are informed by the fiscal plans included in
the government’s 2024 budget and the updated
national accounts for 2023. The stock of maturing
postal bonds is included in the debt projections.

134

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the
government has already announced, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates the latest annual
budget, any supplementary budget, any proposed
new budget and medium-term fiscal plan, and the
IMF staff estimations.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing
requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for
some statistical discrepancies between above-the-line
and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for
2024 are informed by the estimates in Pre-Criterios
2025; projections for 2024 onward assume continued compliance with rules established in the Federal
Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2023–29
are based on the IMF staff ’s forecast framework and
are also informed by the authorities’ draft budget
plan and Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
projections.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
FY2023/24 Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff ’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption
of unchanged policies. Projections for 2024 reflect
information available in the 2024 budget proposal.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by
the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, which was prepared in October 2023,
certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board.
Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended in March
2022 by the government in response to the
sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine,
allowing for windfall oil and gas revenues above
benchmark to be used to finance a larger deficit in
2022 as well as savings accumulated in the National
Welfare Fund. The 2023–25 budget was based on
a modified rule with a two-year transition period
which set the benchmark oil and gas revenues
fixed in rubles at Rub 8 trillion, compared with a
fixed benchmark oil price at $40 a barrel under the
2019 fiscal rule. However, in late September 2023,
the Ministry of Finance proposed reverting to the

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
earlier version of the fiscal rule from 2024 onward
but sets the benchmark oil price at $60 a barrel.
The new rule allows for higher oil and gas revenues
to be spent, but it simultaneously targets a smaller
primary structural deficit.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff ’s baseline fiscal
projections are based primarily on its understanding of government policies as outlined in the
2024 budget and recent official announcements.
Export oil revenues are based on WEO baseline
oil price assumptions and the IMF staff ’s understanding of oil production adjustments under the
OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC
oil exporters) agreement and those unilaterally
announced by Saudi Arabia.
Singapore: FY2023 projections are based on
revised figures based on budget execution through
the end of 2023. FY2024 projections are based
on the initial budget of February 16, 2024. Staff
projections include (1) an increase in the Goods
and Services Tax from 8 percent to 9 percent on
January 1, 2024; and (2) an increase of the carbon
tax from S$5 a tonne to S$25 a tonne in 2024 and
2025 and S$45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are informed by
the 2023 budget. Nontax revenue excludes transactions in financial assets and liabilities, as they
involve primarily revenues associated with realized
exchange rate valuation gains from the holding of
foreign currency deposits, sale of assets, and conceptually similar items.
Spain: Fiscal projections for 2023 assume energy
support measures amounting to 1 percent of GDP,
which are phased out throughout 2024. Figures for
2021–28 reflect disbursements of grants and loans
under the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff ’s macroeconomic forecasts.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s
fiscal rules.
Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the
IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some

revenue and expenditure items that are included in
the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based
on the March 2024 forecast from the Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the January 2024
release on public sector finances from the Office
for National Statistics. The IMF staff ’s projections
take the OBR forecast as a reference and overlay
adjustments (for differences in assumptions) to both
revenues and expenditures. The IMF staff ’s forecasts do not necessarily assume that the fiscal rules
announced on November 17, 2022, will be met at
the end of the forecast period. Data are presented
on a calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on
the February 2024 Congressional Budget Office
baseline, adjusted for the IMF staff ’s policy and
macroeconomic assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each economy. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range; they
will decrease when indicators suggest inflation will
not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that output
growth is below its potential rate, and that the margin
of slack in the economy is significant. With regard to
interest rates, please refer to the Assumptions section
at the beginning of the Statistical Appendix.
Argentina: Monetary projections are consistent
with the overall macroeconomic framework, the
fiscal and financing plans, and the monetary and
foreign exchange policies.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with the convergence of inflation within the
tolerance band by the end of 2024.
Canada: Projections reflect the gradual unwinding of monetary policy tightening by the Bank of
Canada, as inflation slowly returns to its mid-range
target of 2 percent by early 2025.
Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target.

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

135

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

Box A1 (continued)
China: The overall monetary policy stance was
moderately accommodative in 2023 and is expected
to remain broadly accommodative in 2024.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg
to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are drawn from a suite of
models (semi-structural, DSGE [dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium], Taylor rule), market expectations, and the European Central Bank Governing
Council communications.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The
IMF staff assumes that the currency board system
will remain intact.
Hungary: The IMF staff ’s estimates and projections are informed by expert judgment based on
recent developments.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in
line with inflation within the central bank’s target
band over the medium term.
Israel: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
gradual normalization of monetary policy.
Japan: Monetary policy assumptions are in line
with market expectations.
Korea: Projections assume that the policy rate
will evolve in line with the Bank of Korea’s forward
guidance.
Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with inflation converging to the central bank’s
target over the projection period.

136

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

New Zealand: Monetary projections are based
on the IMF staff ’s analysis and expected inflation
path.
Russia: Monetary policy projections assume
that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is
adopting a tight monetary policy stance.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are
based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg
to the US dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in
line with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are
consistent with maintaining inflation within the
3–6 percent target band over the medium term.
Sweden: Monetary policy assumptions are based
on IMF staff estimates.
Switzerland: The inflation outlook suggests that
the Swiss National Bank can keep interest rates on
hold in 2024.
Türkiye: The baseline assumes that the monetary policy stance will remain in line with market
expectations.
United Kingdom: Monetary policy assumptions
for the UK are based on the IMF staff ’s assessment of the most likely path for interest rates,
considering the broader macroeconomic outlook,
model results, the Bank of England’s inflation
forecasts and communications, and market
expectations.
United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal
Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the
federal funds target rate in line with the broader
macroeconomic outlook.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US
dollar values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were
weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual
countries’ national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are
from the balance of payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus
investment (I) is equal to the current account balance (CAB) (S − I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance
(KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group
composition due to data availability.
1 Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
APRIL 2024

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the Fiscal
Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on April 3, 2024.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with staff ’s
assessment of the global economic outlook,
risks, and policy priorities. They welcomed
the continued global economic resilience and
containment of financial sector risks throughout the
last two years, despite significant central bank interest
rate hikes aimed at restoring price stability. Directors
broadly concurred that the global economy may be
approaching a soft landing but recognized that future
growth is expected to be low by historical standards,
reflecting still‑high borrowing costs, a withdrawal
of fiscal support, weak productivity growth, and
continued geopolitical tensions. Most Directors also
agreed that increasing geoeconomic fragmentation will
weigh on medium‑term growth, while a few Directors
highlighted that trade diversification will bring
benefits. Directors regretted that, for many emerging
market and developing economies, the subdued
prospects for global growth imply a slower convergence
toward higher living standards.
Directors broadly considered that risks to the
outlook are now more balanced, while emphasizing
that important downside risks remain. In particular,
they noted that supply disruptions and new price
spikes stemming from geopolitical tensions could raise
interest rate expectations and prompt a resurgence in
volatility and sharp downturns in asset prices. Directors
also emphasized that more persistent‑than‑expected
inflation could trigger capital flow movements, a sharp
tightening of global financial conditions, exchange
rate volatility, and may put external and financial
sectors under pressure. They recognized the risk that
the cooling effects of past monetary policy tightening
could be yet to come. Directors noted growing stresses
in the commercial real estate sector and residential
housing markets in some countries. At the same time,
they recognized upside risks to the outlook from
several sources, including a faster‑than‑expected decline

in inflation as well as growth and productivity gains
from enhanced structural reforms.
Directors called on central banks to ensure that
inflation returns to target smoothly, by avoiding
easing policy prematurely. They emphasized that the
pace of monetary policy normalization should remain
data dependent, be tailored to country circumstances,
and clearly communicated. Where inflation and
inflation expectations are approaching target, Directors
agreed that central banks should gradually move to
a more neutral policy stance to avoid inflation target
undershoots.
Noting elevated fiscal deficits and debt levels in
many countries as well as rising debt service costs,
Directors called for a gradual medium‑term fiscal
consolidation to ensure debt sustainability and rebuild
room for budgetary maneuver, priority investments,
and targeted social spending to protect the most
vulnerable. The fiscal adjustment would also support
the disinflation process. Directors emphasized that
the pace of consolidation should depend on each
country’s conditions and be embedded in a credible
medium‑term fiscal framework. They noted that
historical data indicate that spending pressures could
rise as a result of the record number of elections this
year. In addition, Directors recognized that many
economies face important medium‑term spending
pressures stemming from aging population, climate
change, and development needs. Most Directors
agreed that countries should boost long‑term growth
by implementing well‑designed, cost‑effective fiscal
policies that promote innovation and facilitate
technology diffusion. At the same time, Directors
emphasized that these policies should avoid
protectionist measures.
Directors reiterated that continued accumulation of
public and private debt in many economies constitute
medium‑term financial vulnerabilities. They stressed

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

179

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK—Steady but Slow: Resilience amid Divergence

that regulatory authorities should use supervisory
tools, including stress tests, to ensure that banks and
nonbank financial institutions are resilient to credit
risk and strains in commercial and residential real
estate. Given potential new risks associated with
rapid growth in private credit, Directors saw merit
in considering a more proactive regulatory and
supervisory approach, including enhancing reporting
requirements. Noting that cyber incidents are a rising
financial stability concern, they recommended better
cyber‑related governance arrangements and legislations.
Directors emphasized the need for a full and timely
implementation of Basel III.
Directors agreed that targeted and carefully
sequenced structural reforms are needed to raise
medium‑term growth prospects. They recommended

180

International Monetary Fund | April 2024

reforms aimed at reducing the misallocation of capital
and labor, increasing female labor participation,
enhancing education, strengthening governance,
reducing excessive business regulation and restrictions
on trade, and harnessing the potential of artificial
intelligence. Directors also called for reforms to
facilitate the green transition and build climate
resilience, while managing energy security risks. Many
Directors expressed support for regular coverage of
climate issues in the Fund’s flagship reports.
Directors emphasized that reinvigorating multilateral
cooperation is crucial to limit the costs and risks of
climate change, speed the green transition, safeguard
the open and rule‑based international trading system,
facilitate debt restructuring processes, and strengthen
the resilience of the international monetary system.
