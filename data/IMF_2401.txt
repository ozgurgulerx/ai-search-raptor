Moderating Inflation and Steady Growth Open Path to Soft Landing

point higher than that in the October 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO) on account of greater-thanexpected resilience in the United States and several large emerging market and developing economies, as well as fiscal
support in China. The forecast for 2024–25 is, however, below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.8 percent,
with elevated central bank policy rates to fight inflation, a withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weighing on
economic activity, and low underlying productivity growth. Inflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, in
the midst of unwinding supply-side issues and restrictive monetary policy. Global headline inflation is expected to
fall to 5.8 percent in 2024 and to 4.4 percent in 2025, with the 2025 forecast revised down.
With disinflation and steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing has receded, and risks to global growth are
broadly balanced. On the upside, faster disinflation could lead to further easing of financial conditions. Looser fiscal
policy than necessary and than assumed in the projections could imply temporarily higher growth, but at the risk of
a more costly adjustment later on. Stronger structural reform momentum could bolster productivity with positive
cross-border spillovers. On the downside, new commodity price spikes from geopolitical shocks––including continued
attacks in the Red Sea––and supply disruptions or more persistent underlying inflation could prolong tight
monetary conditions. Deepening property sector woes in China or, elsewhere, a disruptive turn to tax hikes and
spending cuts could also cause growth disappointments.
Policymakers’ near-term challenge is to successfully manage the final descent of inflation to target, calibrating
monetary policy in response to underlying inflation dynamics and—where wage and price pressures are clearly
dissipating—adjusting to a less restrictive stance. At the same time, in many cases, with inflation declining and
economies better able to absorb effects of fiscal tightening, a renewed focus on fiscal consolidation to rebuild budgetary
capacity to deal with future shocks, raise revenue for new spending priorities, and curb the rise of public debt is
needed. Targeted and carefully sequenced structural reforms would reinforce productivity growth and debt
sustainability and accelerate convergence toward higher income levels. More efficient multilateral coordination is
needed for, among other things, debt resolution, to avoid debt distress and create space for necessary investments, as
well as to mitigate the effects of climate change.

Forces Shaping the Outlook
The global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the
cost-of-living crisis is proving surprisingly resilient. Inflation is falling faster than expected from its
2022 peak, with a smaller-than-expected toll on employment and activity, reflecting favorable supplyside developments and tightening by central banks, which has kept inflation expectations anchored.
At the same time, high interest rates aimed at fighting inflation and a withdrawal of fiscal support
amid high debt are expected to weigh on growth in 2024.
Growth resilient in major economies. Economic growth is estimated to have been stronger than expected in
the second half of 2023 in the United States, and several major emerging market and developing
economies. In several cases, government and private spending contributed to the upswing, with real
disposable income gains supporting consumption amid still-tight––though easing––labor markets and
households drawing down on their accumulated pandemic-era savings. A supply-side expansion also
took hold, with a broad-based increase in labor force participation, resolution of pandemic-era supply
chain problems, and declining delivery times. The rising momentum was not felt everywhere, with
notably subdued growth in the euro area, reflecting weak consumer sentiment, the lingering effects of

high energy prices, and weakness in interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing and business investment.
Low-income economies continue to experience large output losses compared with their prepandemic
(2017–19) paths amid elevated borrowing costs.
Inflation subsiding faster than expected. Amid favorable
global supply developments, inflation has been falling
faster than expected, with recent monthly readings
near the prepandemic average for both headline and
underlying (core) inflation (Figure 1). Global headline
inflation in the fourth quarter of 2023 is estimated to
have been about 0.3 percentage point lower than
predicted in the October 2023 WEO on a quarterover-quarter seasonally adjusted basis. Diminished
inflation reflects the fading of relative price shocks––
notably those to energy prices––and their associated
pass-through to core inflation.1 The decline also
reflects an easing in labor market tightness, with a
decline in job vacancies, a modest rise in
unemployment, and greater labor supply, in some
cases associated with a strong inflow of immigrants.
Wage growth has generally remained contained, with
wage-price spirals—in which prices and wages
accelerate together––not taking hold. Near-term
inflation expectations have fallen in major economies,
with long-term expectations remaining anchored.

Note: The figure plots the median of a sample of 57 economies that accounts for
78 percent of World Economic Outlook world GDP (in weighted purchasing-powerparity terms) in 2023. Vertical axes are cut off at –4 percent and 16 percent. The
bands depict the 10th to 90th percentiles of inflation across economies. "Core
inflation" is the percent change in the consumer price index for goods and services,
excluding food and energy (or the closest available measure). AEs = advanced
economies; EMDEs = emerging market and developing economies.

High borrowing costs cooling demand. To reduce inflation,
major central banks raised policy interest rates to
restrictive levels in 2023, resulting in high mortgage
costs, challenges for firms refinancing their debt, tighter credit availability, and weaker business and
residential investment. Commercial real estate has been especially under pressure, with higher
borrowing costs compounding postpandemic structural changes. But with inflation easing, market
expectations that future policy rates will decline have contributed to a reduction in longer-term interest
rates and rising equity markets (Box 1). Still, long-term borrowing costs remain high in both advanced
and emerging market and developing economies, partly because government debt has been rising. In
addition, central banks’ policy rate decisions are becoming increasingly asynchronous. In some
countries with falling inflation––including Brazil and Chile, where central banks tightened policy earlier
than in other countries––interest rates have been declining since the second half of 2023. In China,
where inflation has been near zero, the central bank has eased monetary policy. The Bank of Japan has
kept short-term interest rates near zero.
Fiscal policy amplifying economic divergences. Governments in advanced economies eased fiscal policy in
2023. The United States, where GDP had already exceeded its prepandemic path, eased policy more
than did euro area and other economies in which the recovery was incomplete. In emerging market
and developing economies, in which output has on average fallen even further below the prepandemic
trend, on average the fiscal stance is estimated to have been neutral. The exceptions include Brazil and
1 The annual average oil price is estimated to have declined by about 16 percent in 2023. In October 2023, in the context of the conflict in Gaza and Israel, oil prices

initially increased, followed by a retrenchment as concerns about a regional escalation of the conflict declined.

Russia, where fiscal policy eased in 2023. In low-income countries, liquidity squeezes and the elevated
cost of interest payments—averaging 13 percent of general government revenues, about double the
level 15 years ago––crowded out necessary investments, hampering the recovery of large output losses
compared with prepandemic trends. In 2024, the fiscal policy stance is expected to tighten in several
advanced and emerging market and developing economies to rebuild budgetary room for maneuver
and curb the rising path of debt, and this shift is expected to slow growth in the near term.

The Forecast
Growth Outlook: Resilient but Slow
Global growth, estimated at 3.1 percent in 2023, is projected to remain at 3.1 percent in 2024 before
rising modestly to 3.2 percent in 2025 (Table 1). Compared with that in the October 2023 WEO, the
forecast for 2024 is about 0.2 percentage point higher, reflecting upgrades for China, the United
States, and large emerging market and developing economies. Nevertheless, the projection for global
growth in 2024 and 2025 is below the historical (2000–19) annual average of 3.8 percent, reflecting
restrictive monetary policies and withdrawal of fiscal support, as well as low underlying productivity
growth. Advanced economies are expected to see growth decline slightly in 2024 before rising in
2025, with a recovery in the euro area from low growth in 2023 and a moderation of growth in the
United States. Emerging market and developing economies are expected to experience stable growth
through 2024 and 2025, with regional differences.
World trade growth is projected at 3.3 percent in 2024 and 3.6 percent in 2025, below its historical
average growth rate of 4.9 percent. Rising trade distortions and geoeconomic fragmentation are
expected to continue to weigh on the level of global trade. Countries imposed about 3,200 new
restrictions on trade in 2022 and about 3,000 in 2023, up from about 1,100 in 2019, according to
Global Trade Alert data.
These forecasts are based on assumptions that fuel and nonfuel commodity prices will decline in
2024 and 2025 and that interest rates will decline in major economies. Annual average oil prices are
projected to fall by about 2.3 percent in 2024, whereas nonfuel commodity prices are expected to fall
by 0.9 percent. IMF staff projections are for policy rates to remain at current levels for the Federal
Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England until the second half of 2024, before
gradually declining as inflation moves closer to targets. The Bank of Japan is projected to maintain an
overall accommodative stance.
For advanced economies, growth is projected to decline slightly from 1.6 percent in 2023 to 1.5 percent in
2024 before rising to 1.8 percent in 2025. An upward revision of 0.1 percentage point for 2024
reflects stronger-than-expected US growth, partly offset by weaker-than-expected growth in the euro
area.
•

In the United States, growth is projected to fall from 2.5 percent in 2023 to 2.1 percent in 2024
and 1.7 percent in 2025, with the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening, gradual fiscal
tightening, and a softening in labor markets slowing aggregate demand. For 2024, an upward
revision of 0.6 percentage point since the October 2023 WEO largely reflects statistical
carryover effects from the stronger-than-expected growth outcome for 2023.

•

Growth in the euro area is projected to recover from its low rate of an estimated 0.5 percent in
2023, which reflected relatively high exposure to the war in Ukraine, to 0.9 percent in 2024 and
1.7 percent in 2025. Stronger household consumption as the effects of the shock to energy

prices subside and inflation falls, supporting real income growth, is expected to drive the
recovery. Compared with the October 2023 WEO forecast, however, growth is revised
downward by 0.3 percentage point for 2024, largely on account of carryover from the weakerthan-expected outcome for 2023.
•

Among other advanced economies, growth in the United Kingdom is projected to rise modestly,
from an estimated 0.5 percent in 2023 to 0.6 percent in 2024, as the lagged negative effects of
high energy prices wane, then to 1.6 percent in 2025, as disinflation allows an easing in financial
conditions and permits real incomes to recover. The markdown to growth in 2025 of 0.4
percentage point reflects reduced scope for growth to catch up in light of recent upward
statistical revisions to the level of output through the pandemic period. Output in Japan is
projected to remain above potential as growth decelerates from an estimated 1.9 percent in 2023
to 0.9 percent in 2024 and 0.8 percent in 2025, reflecting the fading of one-off factors that
supported activity in 2023, including a depreciated yen, pent-up demand, and a recovery in
business investment following earlier delays in implementing projects.
In emerging market and developing economies, growth is expected to remain at 4.1 percent in 2024 and to
rise to 4.2 percent in 2025. An upward revision of 0.1 percentage point for 2024 since October 2023
reflects upgrades for several regions.

•

Growth in emerging and developing Asia is expected to decline from an estimated 5.4 percent in 2023
to 5.2 percent in 2024 and 4.8 percent in 2025, with an upgrade of 0.4 percentage point for 2024
over the October 2023 projections, attributable to China’s economy. Growth in China is projected
at 4.6 percent in 2024 and 4.1 percent in 2025, with an upward revision of 0.4 percentage point
for 2024 since the October 2023 WEO. The upgrade reflects carryover from stronger-thanexpected growth in 2023 and increased government spending on capacity building against natural
disasters. Growth in India is projected to remain strong at 6.5 percent in both 2024 and 2025,
with an upgrade from October of 0.2 percentage point for both years, reflecting resilience in
domestic demand.

•

Growth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to pick up from an estimated 2.7 percent in
2023 to 2.8 percent in 2024, before declining to 2.5 percent in 2025. The forecast upgrade for
2024 of 0.6 percentage point over October 2023 projections is attributable to Russia’s economy.
Growth in Russia is projected at 2.6 percent in 2024 and 1.1 percent in 2025, with an upward
revision of 1.5 percentage points over the October 2023 figure for 2024, reflecting carryover
from stronger-than-expected growth in 2023 on account of high military spending and private
consumption, supported by wage growth in a tight labor market.

•

In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is projected to decline from an estimated 2.5 percent in
2023 to 1.9 percent in 2024 before rising to 2.5 percent in 2025, with a downward revision for 2024
of 0.4 percentage point compared with the October 2023 WEO projection. The forecast revision
for 2024 reflects negative growth in Argentina in the context of a significant policy adjustment to
restore macroeconomic stability. Among other major economies in the region, there are upgrades
of 0.2 percentage point for Brazil and 0.6 percentage point for Mexico, largely due to carryover
effects from stronger-than-expected domestic demand and higher-than-expected growth in large
trading-partner economies in 2023.

•

Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is projected to rise from an estimated 2.0 percent in 2023
to 2.9 percent in 2024 and 4.2 percent in 2025, with a downward revision of 0.5 percentage point
for 2024 and an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point for 2025 from the October 2023
projections. The revisions are mainly attributable to Saudi Arabia and reflect temporarily lower oil
production in 2024, including from unilateral cuts and cuts in line with an agreement through
OPEC+ (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Russia and other nonOPEC oil exporters), whereas non-oil growth is expected to remain robust.

•

In sub-Saharan Africa, growth is projected to rise from an estimated 3.3 percent in 2023 to 3.8
percent in 2024 and 4.1 percent in 2025, as the negative effects of earlier weather shocks
subside and supply issues gradually improve. The downward revision for 2024 of 0.2 percentage
point from October 2023 mainly reflects a weaker projection for South Africa on account of
increasing logistical constraints, including those in the transportation sector, on economic
activity.

Inflation Outlook: Steady Decline to Target
Global headline inflation is expected to fall from an estimated 6.8 percent in 2023 (annual average) to
5.8 percent in 2024 and 4.4 percent in 2025. The global forecast is unrevised for 2024 compared with
October 2023 projections and revised down by 0.2 percentage point for 2025. Advanced economies
are expected to see faster disinflation, with inflation falling by 2.0 percentage points in 2024 to 2.6
percent, than are emerging market and developing economies, where inflation is projected to decline
by just 0.3 percentage point to 8.1 percent. The forecast is revised down for both 2024 and 2025 for
advanced economies, while it is revised up for 2024 for emerging market and developing economies,
mainly on account of Argentina where the realignment of relative prices and elimination of legacy
price controls, past currency depreciation, and the related pass-through into prices is expected to
increase inflation in the near term. The drivers of declining inflation differ by country but generally
reflect lower core inflation as a result of still-tight monetary policies, a related softening in labor
markets, and pass-through effects from earlier and ongoing declines in relative energy prices.
Overall, about 80 percent of the world’s economies are expected to see lower annual average headline
and core inflation in 2024. Among economies with an inflation target, headline inflation is projected
to be 0.6 percentage point above target for the median economy by the fourth quarter of 2024, down
from an estimated gap of 1.7 percentage points at the end of 2023. Most of these economies are
expected to reach their targets (or target range midpoints) by 2025. In several major economies, the
downward revision to the projected path of inflation, combined with a modest upgrade to economic
activity, implies a softer-than-expected landing.

With the likelihood of a hard landing receding as adverse supply shocks unwind, risks to the global
outlook are broadly balanced. There is scope for further upside surprises to global growth, although
other potential factors pull the distribution of risks in the opposite direction.
Upside risks. Stronger global growth than expected could arise from several sources:
•

Faster disinflation: In the near term, the risk that inflation will fall faster than expected could again
become a reality, with stronger-than-expected pass-through from lower fuel prices, further
downward shifts in the ratio of vacancies to unemployed persons, and a compression of profit
margins to absorb past cost increases. Combined with a decline in inflation expectations, such
developments could allow central banks to move forward with their policy-easing plans and could
also contribute to improving business, consumer, and financial market sentiment, as well as
raising growth.

•

Slower-than-assumed withdrawal of fiscal support: Governments in major economies might withdraw
fiscal policy support more slowly than necessary and than assumed during 2024–25, implying
higher-than-projected global growth in the near term. However, such delays could in some cases
exacerbate inflation and, with elevated public debt, result in higher borrowing costs and a more
disruptive policy adjustment, with a negative impact on global growth later on.

•

Faster economic recovery in China: Additional property sector–related reforms––including faster
restructuring of insolvent property developers while protecting home buyers’ interests––or largerthan-expected fiscal support could boost consumer confidence, bolster private demand, and
generate positive cross-border growth spillovers.

•

Artificial intelligence and supply-side reforms: Over the medium term, artificial intelligence could boost
workers’ productivity and incomes, although this would depend on countries’ harnessing the
potential of artificial intelligence. Advanced economies may experience benefits from artificial
intelligence sooner than emerging market and developing economies, largely because their
employment structures are more focused on cognitive-intensive roles.2 For emerging market and
developing economies with constrained policy environments, faster progress on implementing
supply-enhancing reforms could result in greater-than-expected domestic and foreign investment
and productivity and faster convergence to higher income levels.

Downside risks. Several adverse risks to global growth remain plausible:
•

Commodity price spikes amid geopolitical and weather shocks: The conflict in Gaza and Israel could
escalate further into the wider region, which produces about 35 percent of the world’s oil exports
and 14 percent of its gas exports. Continued attacks in the Red Sea––through which 11 percent of
global trade flows––and the ongoing war in Ukraine risk generating fresh adverse supply shocks
to the global recovery, with spikes in food, energy, and transportation costs. Container shipping
costs have already sharply increased, and the situation in the Middle East remains volatile. Further
geoeconomic fragmentation could also constrain the cross-border flow of commodities, causing
additional price volatility. More extreme weather shocks, including floods and drought, could,
together with the El Niño phenomenon, also cause food price spikes, exacerbate food insecurity,

and jeopardize the global disinflation process.
•

Persistence of core inflation, requiring a tighter monetary policy stance: A slower-than-expected decline in
core inflation in major economies due, for example, to persistent labor market tightness and
renewed tensions in supply chains could trigger a rise in interest rate expectations and a fall in
asset prices, as in early 2023. Such developments could increase financial stability risks, tighten
global financial conditions, trigger flight-to-safety capital flows, and strengthen the US dollar, with
adverse consequences for trade and growth.

•

Faltering of growth in China: Absent a comprehensive restructuring policy package for the troubled
property sector, real estate investment could drop more than expected, and for longer, with
negative implications for domestic growth and trading partners. Unintended fiscal tightening in
response to local government financing constraints is also possible, as is reduced household
consumption in a context of subdued confidence.

•

Disruptive turn to fiscal consolidation: Fiscal consolidation is necessary in many economies to deal
with rising debt ratios. But an excessively sharp shift to tax hikes and spending cuts, beyond
what is envisaged, could result in slower-than-expected growth in the near term. Adverse market
reactions could pressure some countries that lack a credible medium-term consolidation plan or
face a risk of debt distress to undertake harsh adjustments. In low-income countries and
emerging market economies, the risk of debt distress remains elevated, constraining scope for
necessary growth-enhancing investments.

Policy Priorities
As inflation declines toward target levels across regions, the near-term priority for central banks is to
deliver a smooth landing, neither lowering rates prematurely nor delaying such lowering too much.
With inflation drivers and dynamics differing across economies, policy needs for ensuring price
stability are increasingly differentiated. At the same time, in many cases, amid rising debt and limited
budgetary room to maneuver, and with inflation declining and economies better able to absorb
effects of fiscal tightening, a renewed focus on fiscal consolidation is needed. Intensifying supplyenhancing reforms would facilitate both inflation and debt reduction and enable a durable rise in
living standards.
Managing the final descent of inflation. The faster-than-expected fall in inflation is allowing an increasing
number of central banks to move from raising policy rates to adjusting to a less restrictive stance. In
this context, ensuring that wage and price pressures are clearly dissipating and avoiding the
appearance of prematurely “declaring victory” will guard against later having to backpedal in the
event of upside surprises to inflation. At the same time, where measures of underlying inflation and
expectations are clearly moving toward target-consistent levels, adjusting rates to more neutral levels–
–while signaling continued commitment to price stability––may be necessary (considering long
transmission lags) to avoid protracted economic weakness and target undershoots. In some emerging
market economies, in which the monetary tightening cycle paved the way for earlier rate reductions,
continuing to calibrate the pace of monetary adjustments based on a broad array of wage and price
pressure gauges is appropriate. With borrowing costs still high, careful monitoring of financing
conditions and readiness to deploy financial stability tools will remain vital for avoiding financial
sector strains.
Rebuilding buffers to prepare for future shocks and achieving debt sustainability. With fiscal deficits above

prepandemic levels and higher debt-service costs, fiscal consolidation based on credible medium-term
plans, with the pace of adjustment depending upon country-specific circumstances, is warranted to
restore room for budgetary maneuver. Increasing fiscal balances over a sustained period, while
protecting priority investments and support to the vulnerable, is needed in many cases. Well-calibrated
plans can support fiscal policy credibility, allow the pace of consolidation to be adjusted as a function of
the strength of private demand, and avert disruptive front-loaded adjustments. Mobilizing domestic
revenue, addressing spending rigidities, and reinforcing institutional fiscal frameworks are likely to
support adjustment efforts, both in economies with sizable spending needs and in others as well. For
countries in or at high risk of debt distress, orderly debt restructuring may also be necessary. Faster and
more efficient coordination on debt resolution, through the Group of Twenty Common Framework
and the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, would help mitigate the risk of debt distress spreading.
Enabling durable medium-term growth. Targeted and carefully sequenced structural reforms can reinforce
productivity growth and reverse declining medium-term growth prospects despite constrained policy
space. Bundling reforms that alleviate the most binding constraints to economic activity can front-load
the resulting output gains, even in the short term, and secure public buy-in.3 Industrial policies can be
pursued where clearly identifiable externalities or important market failures are well established and other
more effective policy options are unavailable, but the policies need to be consistent with World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules. Such policies are more likely to be successful if complemented with
appropriate economy-wide reforms and good governance frameworks. Carbon pricing, subsidies for
green investments, reducing energy subsidies, and carbon border-adjustment mechanisms can speed the
green transition but must be designed to support consistency with WTO rules. Investments in climate
adaptation activities and infrastructure are also needed to support resilience.
Strengthening resilience through multilateral cooperation. Intensified cooperation in areas of common interest
is vital for mitigating the costs of the separation of the world economy into blocs. In addition to
coordination on debt resolution, cooperation is required to mitigate the effects of climate change and
facilitate the green energy transition, building on recent agreements at the 2023 Conference of the
Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). Safeguarding the
transportation of critical minerals, restoring the WTO’s ability to settle trade disputes, and ensuring
the responsible use of potentially disruptive new technologies such as artificial intelligence by, among
other things, upgrading domestic regulatory frameworks and harmonizing global principles are
further priorities. The IMF Board of Governors’ conclusion of the 16th Review of Quotas is a
welcome step that needs now to be followed by members’ providing their consent to their respective
quota increases.

Box 1. GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY UPDATE
Since the October 2023 Global Financial Stability
Report, inflationary pressures have continued to
recede, fueling expectations that monetary policy in
advanced economies will ease in the coming quarters.
The resulting momentous decline in interest rate
expectations in December has driven a broad-based rally in
risky assets. Global financial conditions have loosened, on
net, since October, with that loosening driven by higher
equity valuations, lower volatility, and already compressed
corporate bond spreads (Figure 1.1).

environment. For example, in the United States, after
rising to levels last seen before the global financial crisis, 10-year real rates have reversed their trend to
below 2 percent. Yields have increased since the beginning of 2024 as investors pare back expectations
on the magnitude and pace of monetary policy easing by major central banks.
Investor optimism about the macro outlook stands in contrast to the deterioration of credit
quality among borrowers. Bank credit growth has fallen as the higher interest rates during 2023
have weighed on demand for loans while banks continue to exhibit lower risk tolerance. In the
meantime, defaults continue to mount for some segments of borrowers. Central banks’ balance sheet
reduction so far has been orderly. However, there are signs that lower liquidity in the financial system

rates having episodically spiked over the past few months.

Exposure of the banking system to commercial real
estate is still a concern as tepid demand in some
economies and higher borrowing costs increase risks of
default among commercial real estate borrowers. The
recent insolvency of a giant European property company
serves as a reminder of the fragilities the real estate sector
faces in the current environment of volatile interest rates
and falling real estate prices. US banks also contend with
still-sizable unrealized losses on available-for-sale and heldto-maturity securities. Despite the end-of-year rebound in
equity markets, price-to-book ratios for US regional banks
have not yet fully recovered from the March 2023 turmoil.

Amid significant interest rate volatility, the correlation between emerging market assets and
US Treasury yields has increased. Higher yields in advanced economies have led to outflows in
emerging market assets, although this has reversed since November for local currency assets.
Nevertheless, financial conditions in this higher-rate environment may continue to challenge
economies in some regions, especially those of weaker emerging markets and countries with rapidly
narrowing differentials against interest rates in the United States (Figure 1.2).
