ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during July
30, 2024–August 27, 2024, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established
policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for
selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $81.29 a barrel in
2024 and $72.84 a barrel in 2025; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States will average
5.4 percent in 2024 and 3.9 percent in 2025, that for the euro area will average 3.5 percent in 2024 and 2.8 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will average 0.1 percent in 2024 and 0.5 percent in 2025; and that the 10-year
government bond yield for the United States will average 4.1 percent in 2024 and 3.5 percent in 2025, that for the
euro area will average 2.4 percent in 2024 and 2.5 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will average 1.0 percent in
2024 and 1.3 percent in 2025. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved in the projections. The
estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through October 7, 2024, but may not
reflect the latest published data in all cases. For the date of the last data update for each economy, please refer to
the notes provided in the online WEO database.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
• . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
• – between years or months (for example, 2023–24 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
• /

between years or months (for example, 2023/24) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.

• “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
• “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
• Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data.
• For some countries, the figures for 2023 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the
national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• Following the recent release of the 2021 survey by the World Bank Group’s International Comparison Program for new purchasing-power-parity benchmarks, the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity weights
and GDP valued at purchasing power parity have been updated. For more details, see Box A2 in the Statistical
Appendix.
• For Bangladesh, fiscal year estimates of real GDP and purchasing-power-parity GDP are now used in country
group aggregates.
• For Zimbabwe, the authorities have recently redenominated their national accounts statistics following the
introduction on April 5, 2024 of a new national currency, the Zimbabwe gold, replacing the Zimbabwe
dollar. The use of the Zimbabwe dollar ceased on April 30, 2024.

In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• Tables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw
on data from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.
• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
• Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
• The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of
the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya
Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Jean Marc Natal, Deputy Division Chief, Research
Department.

FOREWORD

The Global Battle against Inflation Is
Almost Won; A Policy Triple Pivot Is
Now Needed
The global battle against inflation has largely been
won, even though price pressures persist in some
countries. After peaking at 9.4 percent year over year
in the third quarter of 2022, headline inflation rates
are now projected to reach 3.5 percent by the end of
2025, below the average level of 3.6 percent between
2000 and 2019.
Moreover, despite a sharp and synchronized tightening of monetary policy around the world, the global
economy has remained unusually resilient throughout
the disinflationary process, avoiding a global recession.
Growth is projected to hold steady at 3.2 percent in
2024 and 2025, even though a few countries, especially low-income developing countries, have seen
sizable downside growth revisions, often as a result of
increased conflicts.
While the global decline in inflation is a major milestone, downside risks are rising and now dominate the
outlook: an escalation in regional conflicts, monetary
policy remaining tight for too long, a possible resurgence of financial market volatility with adverse effects
on sovereign debt markets (see October 2024 Global
Financial Stability Report), a deeper growth slowdown
in China, and the continued ratcheting up of protectionist policies.
What accounts for the decline in inflation? As
Chapter 2 of this report argues, the surge and subsequent decline in global inflation reflects a unique
combination of shocks: broad supply disruptions
coupled with strong demand pressures in the wake of
the pandemic, followed by sharp spikes in commodity
prices caused by the war in Ukraine. These shocks led
to an upward shift and a steepening of the relationship
between activity and inflation, the Phillips curve. As
supply disruptions eased and monetary policy tightening started to constrain demand, normalization in
labor markets allowed inflation to decline rapidly without a major slowdown in activity. Clearly, much of the
disinflation can be attributed to the unwinding of the

xii

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

shocks themselves, followed by improvements in labor
supply, often linked to immigration. But monetary
policy played an important role too by helping to keep
inflation expectations anchored, avoiding deleterious
wage-price spirals and a repeat of the disastrous inflation experience of the 1970s.
The return of inflation to near central bank targets
paves the way for a much-needed policy triple pivot.
The first—on monetary policy—has started. Since
June, major central banks in advanced economies have
started to cut their policy rates, moving their policy
stance toward neutral. This will support activity at a
time when many advanced economies’ labor markets
are showing signs of weakness, with rising unemployment rates. It will also help ward off the downside
risks.
The change in global monetary conditions is easing
the pressure on emerging market economies, with their
currencies strengthening against the US dollar and
financial conditions improving. This will help reduce
imported inflation pressures, allowing these countries
to pursue more easily their own disinflation path.
However, vigilance remains key. Inflation in services
remains too elevated, almost twice as high as before
the pandemic. Some emerging market economies are
facing a resurgence of inflationary pressures, sometimes because of elevated food prices. Furthermore,
we have now entered a world dominated by supply
disruptions—from climate, health, and geopolitics.
It is always harder for monetary policy to maintain
price stability when faced with such shocks, which
simultaneously increase prices and reduce output.
Finally, while inflation expectations have remained well
anchored this time around, it may be harder next time,
as workers and firms will be more vigilant in protecting their standards of living and profits going forward.
The second pivot is on fiscal policy. Fiscal space
is also a cornerstone of financial stability. After years
of loose fiscal policy, it is now time to stabilize debt
dynamics and rebuild much-needed fiscal buffers.
While the decline in policy rates provides some fiscal
relief by lowering funding costs, this will not be

FOREWORD

sufficient, especially as long-term real interest rates
are much above prepandemic levels. In many countries, primary balances, the difference between fiscal
revenues and public expenditures net of debt service,
need to improve. For some countries, like the United
States and China, debt dynamics are not stabilized
under current fiscal plans (see October 2024 Fiscal
Monitor). In many others, while early fiscal plans
showed promise after the pandemic and cost-of-living
crises, there are increasing signs of slippage. The path
is narrow: unduly delaying adjustment increases the
risk of disorderly market-imposed adjustments, while
an excessively sharp turn toward fiscal consolidation
would be self-defeating and hurt economic activity.
Success requires staying the course by implementing
gradual and credible multiyear adjustments without
delay, where consolidation is necessary. The more
credible and disciplined the fiscal adjustment, the more
monetary policy will be able to play a supporting role.
But the willingness and ability to deliver disciplined
and credible adjustments have been lacking.
The third pivot—and the hardest—is on structural
reforms. Much more needs to be done to improve
growth prospects and lift productivity, as this is the
only way we can address the many challenges we
face: rebuilding fiscal buffers, aging and declining
populations in many parts of the world, young and
growing populations in Africa in search of opportunity,
tackling the climate transition, increasing resilience,
and improving the lives of the most vulnerable, within
and across countries. Unfortunately, medium-term
global growth remains lackluster, at 3.1 percent. While
much of this reflects China’s weaker outlook, medium-term prospects in other regions, such as Latin
America and the European Union, have also deteriorated. The recently published Draghi report offers a

clear-eyed assessment of the diminished prospects in
the region—and the associated challenges.
Faced with increased external competition and structural weaknesses in manufacturing and productivity,
many countries are implementing industrial and trade
policy measures to protect their workers and industries.
While these measures can sometimes boost investment
and activity in the short run—especially when they
rely on debt-financed subsidies—they often lead to
retaliation, are unlikely to deliver sustained improvements in standards of living at home or abroad, and
should be firmly resisted when they do not carefully
address well-identified market failures or national security concerns. Instead, economic growth must come
from ambitious domestic reforms that boost technology and innovation, improve competition and resource
allocation, further economic integration, and stimulate
productive private investment.
Yet while structural reforms are as urgent as ever,
they often face significant social resistance. Chapter 3
of this report explores the factors that shape the social
acceptability of reforms, one of the prerequisites for
their eventual success. A clear message emerges from
the chapter: better communication can only go so far.
Instead, building trust between the government and
its people—a two-way process throughout the policy
design—and the inclusion of proper compensatory
measures to mitigate distributional effects are essential
features. This is an important lesson that should also
resonate when thinking about ways to further improve
international cooperation and bolster our multilateral
efforts to address common challenges as we celebrate the
80th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Global growth is expected to remain stable yet
underwhelming. At 3.2 percent in 2024 and 2025,
the growth projection is virtually unchanged from
those in both the July 2024 World Economic Outlook
Update and the April 2024 World Economic Outlook.
However, notable revisions have taken place beneath
the surface, with upgrades to the forecast for the
United States offsetting downgrades to those for
other advanced economies—in particular, the largest
European countries. Likewise, in emerging market and
developing economies, disruptions to production and
shipping of commodities—especially oil—conflicts,
civil unrest, and extreme weather events have led to
downward revisions to the outlook for the Middle
East and Central Asia and that for sub-Saharan Africa.
These have been compensated for by upgrades to the
forecast for emerging Asia, where surging demand for
semiconductors and electronics, driven by significant
investments in artificial intelligence, has bolstered
growth. The latest forecast for global growth five
years from now––at 3.1 percent—remains mediocre
compared with the prepandemic average. Persistent
structural headwinds—such as population aging and
weak productivity—are holding back potential growth
in many economies.
Cyclical imbalances have eased since the beginning
of the year, leading to a better alignment of economic
activity with potential output in major economies.
This adjustment is bringing inflation rates across countries closer together and on balance has contributed
to lower global inflation. Global headline inflation is
expected to fall from an annual average of 6.7 percent
in 2023 to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 4.3 percent in
2025, with advanced economies returning to their
inflation targets sooner than emerging market and
developing economies. As global disinflation continues
to progress, broadly in line with the baseline, bumps
on the road to price stability are still possible. Goods
prices have stabilized, but services price inflation
remains elevated in many regions, pointing to the
importance of understanding sectoral dynamics and of
calibrating monetary policy accordingly, as discussed in
Chapter 2.

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

Risks to the global outlook are tilted to the downside amid elevated policy uncertainty. Sudden eruptions in financial market volatility—as experienced
in early August—could tighten financial conditions
and weigh on investment and growth, especially in
developing economies in which large near-term external financing needs may trigger capital outflows and
debt distress. Further disruptions to the disinflation
process, potentially triggered by new spikes in commodity prices amid persistent geopolitical tensions,
could prevent central banks from easing monetary
policy, which would pose significant challenges
to fiscal policy and financial stability. Deeper- or
longer-than-expected contraction in China’s property
sector, especially if it leads to financial instability,
could weaken consumer sentiment and generate negative global spillovers given China’s large footprint in
global trade. An intensification of protectionist policies would exacerbate trade tensions, reduce market
efficiency, and further disrupt supply chains. Rising
social tensions could prompt social unrest, hurting
consumer and investor confidence and potentially
delaying the passage and implementation of necessary
structural reforms.
As cyclical imbalances in the global economy
wane, near-term policy priorities should be carefully
calibrated to ensure a smooth landing. In many
countries, shifting gears on fiscal policy is urgently
needed to ensure that public debt is on a sustainable path and to rebuild fiscal buffers; the pace of
adjustment should be tailored to country-specific
circumstances. Structural reforms are necessary to lift
medium-term growth prospects, but support for the
most vulnerable should be maintained. Chapter 3
discusses strategies to enhance the social acceptability
of these reforms—a crucial prerequisite for successful
implementation. Multilateral cooperation is needed
more than ever to accelerate the green transition and
to support debt-restructuring efforts. Mitigating the
risks of geoeconomic fragmentation and strengthening rules-based multilateral frameworks are essential
to ensure that all economies can reap the benefits of
future growth.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Uncertainty Seeping through as
Policies Shift
The past four years have put the resilience of the
global economy to the test. A once-in-a-century pandemic, eruption of geopolitical conflicts, and extreme
weather events have disrupted supply chains, caused
energy and food crises, and prompted governments
to take unprecedented actions to protect lives and
livelihoods. The global economy has demonstrated
resilience overall, but this masks uneven performance
across regions and lingering fragilities.
The negative supply shocks to the global economy since 2020 have had lasting effects on output
and inflation, with varied impacts across individual
countries and country groups. The sharpest contrasts
are between advanced and developing economies.
Whereas the former have caught up with activity and
inflation projected before the pandemic, the latter are
showing more permanent scars (see the October 2023
World Economic Outlook), with large output shortfalls and persistent inflation (Figure 1.1). They also
remain more vulnerable to the types of commodity
price surges that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
(Figure 1.2; October 2023 and April 2024 World
Economic Outlook).
Since the beginning of the year, signs have emerged
that cyclical imbalances are being gradually resorbed,
with economic activity in major economies better
aligned with their potential. These developments
may have helped bring inflation rates across countries
closer together, but the momentum in global disinflation appears to have slowed in the first half of the year
(July 2024 World Economic Outlook Update). Goods
prices have stabilized, and some are declining, but
services price inflation remains high in many countries, partly reflecting rapid wage increases, as pay is
still catching up with the inflation surge of 2021–22.
This has forced some central banks to delay their policy-easing plans (Chapter 2), putting public finances
under more pressure, especially in countries where
debt-servicing costs are already high and refinancing
needs significant.

Now, as before, the global outlook will be shaped
largely by fiscal and monetary choices, their international spillovers, the intensity of geoeconomic fragmentation forces, and the ability of governments to
implement long-overdue structural reforms. With inflation approaching central bank targets and governments
striving to manage debt dynamics, the policy mix is
expected to shift from monetary to fiscal tightening
as monetary policy rates are brought down, closer to
their natural levels. How fast such rotations occur in
individual countries will have consequences for capital
flows and exchange rates.
The level of uncertainty surrounding the outlook
is high. Newly elected governments (about half of the
world population has gone or will go to the polls in
2024) could introduce significant shifts in trade and
fiscal policy (Box 1.2). Moreover, the return of financial market volatility over the summer has stirred old
fears about hidden vulnerabilities. This has heightened
anxiety over the appropriate monetary policy stance—
especially in countries where inflation is persistent and
signs of slowdown are emerging. Further intensification
of geopolitical rifts could weigh on trade, investment,
and the free flow of ideas. This could affect long-term
growth, threaten the resilience of supply chains, and create difficult trade-offs for central banks. On the upside,
governments could succeed in building the necessary
consensus around overdue and difficult-to-pass structural reforms (Chapter 3), which would boost growth
and enhance fiscal sustainability and financial stability.

Steady Disinflation, yet Bumps in the
Road Still Possible
In many advanced economies, disinflation has come
at a relatively low cost to employment, thanks partly
to offsetting supply developments. These included
a faster-than-expected decline in energy prices and
a surprising rebound in labor supply, bolstered
by substantial immigration flows that helped cool
labor markets (April 2024 World Economic Outlook).
Moreover, temporary sectoral bottlenecks during

and after the pandemic led to a steepening of the
Phillips curve and implied a small sacrifice ratio (the
slack required to decrease inflation). As explained in
Chapter 2, a temporarily steeper Philips curve helps
explain both the rapid surge in inflation and the—
so far—relatively painless disinflation (Figure 1.3,
panel 1).
Since the beginning of 2024, signs that cyclical
imbalances are being gradually resorbed have helped
bring inflation rates across countries closer together
(Figure 1.3, panel 2). Disinflation has continued
broadly as expected but did show signs of slowing in
the first half of the year, suggesting potential bumps on
the road to price stability (July 2024 World Economic
Outlook Update). The persistence in core inflation
has been driven primarily by services price inflation.
At 4.2 percent, core services price inflation is about
50 percent higher than before the pandemic in major
advanced and emerging market economies (excluding
the US). This contrasts with core goods price inflation,
which has declined all the way to zero (Figure 1.3,
panel 3). Recent increases in shipping rates, especially
for routes to and from China, have put upward pressure on goods prices. However, this source of upward
pressure has been mitigated so far by declining prices
for exports from China (Figure 1.3, panel 4).
Stubbornness in services price inflation partly
reflects higher nominal wage growth relative to

prepandemic trends. Even as labor market pressure has
started to ease (Figure 1.4, panel 2), wage negotiators
have continued to aim for sizable raises to counter the
cost-of-living squeeze felt after the 2021–22 inflation
surge (Figure 1.4, panel 1). That nominal wage growth
continues to run higher after the inflation surge is
consistent with past inflationary episodes—when real
wages catch up to their equilibrium level determined
by labor productivity—and does not necessarily risk a
wage-price spiral (see Chapter 2 of the October 2022
World Economic Outlook).
With output gaps expected to close, and assuming
no disruptions to labor supply in advanced economies,
wage growth is expected to moderate. Whether recent
increases translate into further persistence in core inflation will depend on (1) the impact of recent real wage
increases on unit labor costs, which itself depends on
labor productivity, and (2) the willingness of firms to
absorb increased unit labor costs in their profit margins.
These two factors seem to be working differently in
the largest two advanced economies but should still
allow disinflation to continue. In the United States,
wage growth has reflected productivity gains lately,
keeping unit labor costs contained. In the euro area,
recent wage increases have exceeded productivity,
raising unit labor costs (Figure 1.4, panel 3). However,
European firms should be able to absorb those costs,
given large increases in profit shares in recent years
(Figure 1.4, panel 4).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Policy Mix: Tight Monetary, Loose Fiscal Policies

Figure 1.5. Monetary Transmission

Economic developments over the past four years
have had a lot to do with how individual countries
have deployed fiscal and monetary policies since the
pandemic.
Following an initial period of easing, monetary policy
has tightened significantly, with central banks in many
emerging markets starting earlier than major central
banks in advanced economies (Chapter 2). Most central
banks stopped increasing nominal policy rates in the
first half of 2023. But real rates continued to rise as
inflation expectations started to decline (Figure 1.5,
panel 1), tightening the monetary policy stance further.
Real policy rates are currently above estimates of the
natural rates and thus are acting to cool down economic
activity and bring inflation back to target.
Higher policy rates have led to higher mortgage and
bank lending rates, a sign that the first leg of monetary
transmission has worked as expected. The pass-through
to market rates has been gradual but seems to have finished. The increase in borrowing costs has in turn held
back private credit growth and investment, moderating
aggregate demand (Figure 1.5, panels 2 and 3).
The contrast with fiscal policy is striking. Despite
a strong rebound in activity in 2022 and generalized
inflationary pressures, fiscal policy has remained looser.
Some slippage with respect to consolidation plans is
evident (see the October 2024 Fiscal Monitor), except in
low-income developing countries, where limited fiscal
space has constrained their ability to tackle energy and
food crises (Figure 1.6, panel 1). From 2022 to 2024,
monetary policy tightened significantly in most countries, but fiscal policy lagged and even eased in many
instances (Figure 1.6, panel 2), complicating the task
of central banks in their effort to rein in inflation and
delaying the necessary rebuilding of fiscal buffers. Tight
monetary policy combined with relatively loose fiscal
policy, particularly relevant in the United States, may be
one of the key factors that has led to dollar appreciation
in 2024.
This is expected to change. With public-debt-servicing costs on an upward trend in emerging market and
developing economies and a recent jump in the United
States (Figure 1.6, panel 3), the baseline assumes a
rotation of the policy mix. Necessary fiscal consolidation in many economies is expected to slow down
growth and calls for looser monetary policy, which
should in turn help governments trim deficits more
easily (see “Policy Priorities: From Restoring Price
Stability to Rebuilding Buffers”).

In the first week of August, global financial markets experienced significant turbulence, interrupting a steady and rapid ascent of equity markets.
Weaker-than-expected jobs data raised concerns about
a potential recession in the United States, leading to
a stock market correction. This, combined with the
Bank of Japan’s decision to hike interest rates, resulted
in a rapid unwinding of Japanese-yen-funded carry
trades, which amplified the equity market correction
(see Box 1.3 of the October 2024 Global Financial
Stability Report and Box 1.4 of the April 2023 Global
Financial Stability Report).
Markets have rapidly stabilized. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility (VIX) Index, after having
surged to its highest point since 2020, has returned to its
historical average. However, vulnerabilities that contributed to the recent increase in market volatility persist.
These include the disconnect between economic uncertainty and market volatility (see Chapter 1 of the October
2024 Global Financial Stability Report) and overstretched
equity valuations, particularly in the technology sector.
Revised market expectations regarding US monetary policy have aligned the outlook for rate cuts there
more closely with those for other advanced economies,
halting the appreciation of the US dollar against the
currencies of major advanced economies. However,
depreciation pressures remain high in emerging market
and developing economies (Figure 1.7, panel 1). Many
of these economies, which began hiking interest rates
earlier, have also started easing earlier, leading to a narrowing of differentials between their policy rates and
that of the United States.
For some emerging market and developing economies faced with large short-term external financing
needs—often a significant share of their buffer of net
international reserves—sovereign borrowing spreads
have increased since April, posing an additional
challenge (Figure 1.7, panel 2). Although few of these
economies are in debt distress—defined as having
spreads greater than 1,000 basis points—heavy reliance
on short-term external financing reveals vulnerabilities
to sudden currency swings.

have started to emerge, with increasingly more trade
occurring within geopolitical blocs rather than between
them (Figure 1.8). Specifically, when the averages for
the periods 2017 to 2022 and 2022 to the first quarter
of 2024 are compared, goods trade growth is observed
to have declined by approximately 2½ percentage
points more between geopolitically distant blocs than
within blocs.
A more fragmented global trade landscape could
emerge if geopolitical tensions continue to develop in a
way similar to that during the Cold War (Figure 1.9).
Although fragmentation, if it goes hand in hand with
an increase in intrabloc trade, may not necessarily
imply rapid deglobalization (Gopinath and others
2024), it could reduce the resilience of global supply
chains, increase funding costs, disrupt cross-border
capital flows (see Chapter 3 of the April 2023 Global

emerging market and developing economies (hampering income convergence), increase costs and risks for
businesses, and induce a larger economic cost for the
green transition (Box 1.1).

The Outlook: Stable yet
Underwhelming—Brace for
Uncertain Times
There has been little change in the global growth
outlook since the April 2024 World Economic Outlook.
Following the postpandemic rebound, the global
projection for GDP growth has been hovering at about
3 percent, both in the short and the medium term.
Weak growth extends beyond the disinflation period,
suggesting that potential growth has been durably
affected (see Chapter 3 of the April 2024 World Economic Outlook).

Note: The figure plots the change in global trade between blocs (panel 1) and with
nonaligned countries (panel 2) during the Cold War (blue line, with t0 = 1947) and since
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (red line, with t0 = 2021:Q4). For each episode, the figure
plots the semi-elasticity of trade for flows, estimated using a difference-in-differences
approach, with bilateral goods trade values on the y-axis, with importer-exporter,
importer-year, and exporter-year fixed effects controlled for, and the associated
90 percent confidence bands. The missing category is trade within blocs. The Cold War
results are obtained using yearly data from 1920 to 1990—excluding the World War II
years (1939–45), and with 1947 as an excluded year—and the bloc definition based on
Gokmen (2017). The results for the most recent period are based on quarterly trade data
from 2017:Q1 to 2024:Q1 (with 2021:Q4 as an excluded quarter), with the wider bloc
definition based on the ideal point distance (a measure based on voting patterns in the
United Nations General Assembly computed by Bailey, Strezhnev, and Voeten [2017]).

is tending to boost activity in the services sector in
advanced and emerging markets but is dampening
manufacturing. Manufacturing production is also
increasingly shifting toward emerging market economies—in particular, China and India—as advanced
economies lose competitiveness (Figure 1.10,
panel 2).

Global Assumptions
The picture is far from monolithic, however, and
important sectoral and regional shifts underpin the
stable global outlook that has emerged since the
April 2024 World Economic Outlook. Relative to
prepandemic trends, goods prices remain elevated
compared with those for services, a lingering effect
of the pandemic and its aftermath, which saw strong
demand for goods alongside supply constraints
(Figure 1.10, panel 1). Consequently, behind stable
growth figures, a global shift from goods to services consumption is underway. This rebalancing

Before regional developments are discussed, it is
important to review the key assumptions about commodity prices and fiscal and monetary policy on which
the baseline projection is predicated.
With acknowledgment of exceptional policy uncertainty associated with newly elected governments in
2024 (in 64 countries representing about half of the
global population), the baseline projection is flanked
with two alternative scenarios, which lay out the main
implications for growth and inflation of shifts in
trade and fiscal policy. The scenarios are meant to be
International Monetary Fund | October 2024

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

illustrative but are quantitatively plausible alternatives
around the baseline (Box 1.2).
• Commodity price assumptions: Oil prices are expected
to rise by 0.9 percent in 2024 to about $81 a barrel
as production cuts by OPEC+ (Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus selected
nonmember countries, including Russia), sustained
global oil demand growth, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East offset strong non-OPEC+
supply growth. Overall, however, prices for fuel
commodities are projected to fall on average by 3.8
percent—owing to declines in prices of natural gas
(by 16.4 percent) and coal (by 18.0 percent) as they
come off their 2022 peaks—but less rapidly than
assumed in April (Figure 1.11, panel 1). Food prices
are expected to decline by 5.2 percent in 2024 and by
a further 4.5 percent in 2025 as global grain production is forecast to reach record highs in 2024–25.
• Monetary policy assumptions: Compared with that in
April 2024, the anticipated trajectory of policy rates
for major central banks in advanced economies has
shifted. In the euro area, 100 basis points of cuts
are expected in 2024 and 50 basis points in 2025,
bringing the policy rate to 2.5 percent by June
2025. In the United States, the Federal Reserve
pivoted to cutting rates in September, starting with
a 50 basis point drop. The federal funds rate is projected to reach its long-term equilibrium of 2.9 percent in the third quarter of 2026, almost a year
earlier than what was expected in April. In Japan,
however, policy rate projections have been revised
upward (since the April 2024 World Economic
Outlook), reflecting the Bank of Japan’s rate hike in
July. The policy rate is projected to continue to rise
gradually over the medium term toward a neutral
setting of about 1.5 percent, consistent with keeping
inflation and inflation expectations anchored at the
Bank of Japan’s 2 percent target.
• Fiscal policy assumptions: Governments in advanced
economies are on average expected to tighten their
fiscal policy stances in both 2024 and 2025, halving primary deficits by 2029. However, contrasts
between the euro area and the United States are
important. In the baseline, the US fiscal deficit is
only marginally trimmed down, remaining at about
6.0 percent in 2029, with about half of this reflecting interest rate expenses. Under current policies,
the US public debt is not stabilized, reaching almost
131.7 percent of GDP in 2029. In the euro area, on
the other hand, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to have stabilized already at about 88 percent in

2024, although with some cross-country differences. Large contrasts are apparent in the emerging
market and developing economies country group as
well. Whereas fiscal stances are expected to remain
relatively loose on average in emerging markets,
fiscal consolidation is ongoing among developing
economies. Over the past few years, many low-­
income countries have either lost market access or

CHAPTER 1

been forced to drastically scale back deficits because
higher interest rates have pushed up borrowing
costs (see Chapter 1 of the October 2024 Global
Financial Stability Report). Forced consolidation is
expected to bring down their debt-to-GDP ratios to
45.8 percent in 2029 from 53.2 percent in 2024, a
reduction of about 1.5 percent of GDP every year.

Baseline Outlook: Stable Growth amid
Continuing Disinflation
Global growth is expected to remain broadly flat—
decelerating from 3.3 percent in 2023 to 3.1 percent by
2029—and is largely unchanged from World Economic
Outlook forecasts in April 2024 and October 2023
(Tables 1.1 and 1.2; Figure 1.12).1 Under the surface,
however, offsetting revisions have brought major economies closer together as cyclical forces wane and GDP
moves closer to potential. As inflation recedes, policy
rates are expected to follow suit, preventing undue
increases in real interest rates. Interest rates are expected
to gradually descend toward their natural levels: the levels of risk-free real interest rates compatible with output
at potential and inflation at target.
Although global revisions to the forecast since April
have been minimal, offsetting shifts at the country
group level reflect recent shocks and policies, most
notably in emerging market and developing economies. Cuts in production and shipping of commodities
(oil in particular), conflicts, and civil unrest have led
to downward revisions to the regional outlooks for
the Middle East and Central Asia and for sub-Saharan
Africa. At the same time, surging demand for semiconductors and electronics, driven by significant
investment in artificial intelligence, has fueled stronger
growth in emerging Asia.

Growth Outlook: Major Economies Draw
Closer Together
Following a reopening rebound in 2022, growth
in advanced economies markedly slowed in 2023 and
is projected to remain steady, oscillating between 1.7
and 1.8 percent until 2029. This apparent stability
conceals differing country dynamics as various cyclical forces unwind and economic activity gets back in

line with potential. In the United States, growth is
expected to decelerate, with output reaching potential
from above by 2029. In the United Kingdom and
the euro area, on the other hand, activity is projected
to accelerate, closing the output gap from below. In
Japan, where the output gap is already closed, GDP is
expected to grow in line with potential.
• In the United States, projected growth for 2024 has
been revised upward to 2.8 percent, which is 0.2
percentage point higher than the July forecast, on
account of stronger outturns in consumption and
nonresidential investment. The resilience of consumption is largely the result of robust increases in
real wages (especially among lower-income households) and wealth effects. Growth is anticipated
to slow to 2.2 percent in 2025 as fiscal policy is
gradually tightened and a cooling labor market
slows consumption. With GDP growth lower than
potential, the output gap is expected to start closing
in 2025.
• In the euro area, growth seems to have reached
its lowest point in 2023. A touch weaker than
projected in April and July 2024, GDP growth is

expected to pick up to a modest 0.8 percent in 2024
as a result of better export performance, in particular of goods. In 2025, growth is projected to rise
further to 1.2 percent, helped by stronger domestic
demand. Rising real wages are expected to boost
consumption, and a gradual loosening of monetary
policy is expected to support investment. Persistent
weakness in manufacturing weighs on growth for
countries such as Germany and Italy. However,
whereas Italy’s domestic demand is expected to benefit from the European Union–financed National
Recovery and Resilience Plan, Germany is experiencing strain from fiscal consolidation and a sharp
decline in real estate prices.
• Offsetting dynamics are also at play among other
advanced economies. Growth is expected to decelerate in Japan in 2024, with the slowdown reflecting
temporary supply disruptions and fading of one-off
factors that boosted activity in 2023, such as the
surge in tourism. With respect to April, growth
is revised downward, by 0.6 percentage point, to
0.3 percent for 2024, reflecting a temporary supply
disruption in the car industry and the base effect of
historical data revisions. An acceleration to 1.1 is
predicted in 2025, with growth boosted by private
consumption as real wage growth strengthens. In
the United Kingdom, in contrast, growth is projected
to have accelerated to 1.1 percent in 2024 and is
expected to continue doing so to 1.5 percent in
2025 as falling inflation and interest rates stimulate
domestic demand.

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

Growth Outlook: Emerging Markets Get
Support from Asia
In a manner similar to that for advanced economies,
the growth outlook for emerging market and developing economies is remarkably stable for the next two
years, hovering at about 4.2 percent and steadying at
3.9 percent by 2029. And just as in advanced economies, offsetting dynamics are occurring between country groups. Compared with that in April, growth in
emerging market and developing economies is revised
upward by 0.1 percentage point for 2024, reflecting
upgrades for Asia (China and India) that more than
offset downgrades for sub-Saharan Africa and for the
Middle East and Central Asia (Table 1.1).
• Emerging Asia’s strong growth is expected to subside,
from 5.7 percent in 2023 to 5.0 percent in 2025.
This reflects a sustained slowdown in the region’s
two largest countries. In India, the outlook is for
GDP growth to moderate from 8.2 percent in 2023
to 7 percent in 2024 and 6.5 percent in 2025,
because pent-up demand accumulated during the
pandemic has been exhausted, as the economy
reconnects with its potential. In China, the slowdown is projected to be more gradual. Despite
persisting weakness in the real estate sector and low
consumer confidence, growth is projected to have
slowed only marginally to 4.8 percent in 2024,
largely thanks to better-than-expected net exports.
Compared with that in April, the forecast has been
revised upward by 0.2 percentage point in 2024 and

CHAPTER 1

0.4 percentage point in 2025. Recent policy measures may provide upside risk to near-term growth.
• In contrast, growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is projected to pick up from an estimated
2.1 percent in 2023 to 3.9 percent in 2025, as the
effect on the region of temporary disruptions to oil
production and shipping are assumed to fade away.
Compared with that in April, the projection has
been revised downward by 0.4 percentage point for
2024, mainly the result of the extension of oil production cuts in Saudi Arabia and ongoing conflict in
Sudan taking a large toll.
• In sub-Saharan Africa, GDP growth is similarly projected to increase, from an estimated 3.6 percent in
2023 to 4.2 percent in 2025, as the adverse impacts
of prior weather shocks abate and supply constraints
gradually ease. Compared with that in April, the
regional forecast is revised downward by 0.2 percentage point for 2024 and upward by 0.1 percentage point for 2025. Besides the ongoing conflict
that has led to a 26 percent contraction of the
South Sudanese economy, the revision reflects slower
growth in Nigeria, amid weaker-than-expected activity in the first half of the year.
• In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is
projected to decline from 2.2 percent in 2023 to
2.1 percent in 2024 before rebounding to 2.5 percent in 2025. In Brazil, growth is projected at
3.0 percent in 2024 and 2.2 percent in 2025. This
is an upward revision of 0.9 percentage point for
2024, compared with July 2024 World Economic
Outlook Update projections, owing to stronger
private consumption and investment in the first half
of the year from a tight labor market, government
transfers, and smaller-than-anticipated disruptions
from floods. However, with the still-restrictive monetary policy and the expected cooling of the labor
market, growth is expected to moderate in 2025.
In Mexico, growth is projected at 1.5 percent in
2024, reflecting weakening domestic demand on the
back of monetary policy tightening, before slowing
further to 1.3 percent in 2025 on a tighter fiscal
stance. Overall, offsetting revisions leave the regional
growth forecast broadly unchanged since April.
• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is
projected to remain steady at 3.2 percent in 2024
but to ease significantly to 2.2 percent in 2025.
The moderation reflects a sharp slowdown in
Russia from 3.6 percent in 2023 to 1.3 percent in
2025 as private consumption and investment slow

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

amid reduced tightness in the labor market and
slower wage growth. In Türkiye, growth is expected
to slow from 5.1 percent in 2023 to 2.7 percent
in 2025, with the slowdown driven by the shift
to monetary and fiscal policy tightening since
mid-2023.

Inflation Outlook: Gradual Decline to Target
Although bumps on the path to price stability are
still possible, global headline inflation is projected to
decrease further, from an average of 6.7 percent in
2023 to 5.8 percent in 2024 and 4.3 percent in 2025
in the baseline. Disinflation is expected to be faster in
advanced economies—with a decline of 2 percentage
points from 2023 to 2024 and a stabilization at about
2 percent in 2025—than in emerging market and
developing economies, in which inflation is projected
to decline from 8.1 percent in 2023 to 7.9 percent
in 2024 and then fall at a faster pace in 2025 to
5.9 percent.
There is a great deal of variation across emerging
market economies, however, which is evident in the
difference between median and average inflation
(Figure 1.13, panel 1). Inflation in emerging Asia is
projected to be on par with that in advanced economies, at 2.1 percent in 2024 and 2.7 percent in
2025, in part thanks to early monetary tightening
and price controls in many countries in the region. In
contrast, inflation forecasts for emerging and developing Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and
sub-Saharan Africa remain in double-digit territory on
account of large outliers amid pass-through of past currency depreciation and administrative price adjustment
(Egypt) and underperformance in agriculture (Ethiopia). For most countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean, inflation rates have dropped significantly
from their peaks and continue to be on a downward
trend. However, large countries in the region have
experienced upward revisions since the April 2024
World Economic Outlook that reflect a mix of (1) robust
wage growth preventing faster disinflation in the
services sector (Brazil, Mexico), (2) weather events
(Colombia), and (3) hikes in regulated electricity tariffs
(Chile).
The decline in global inflation in 2024 and 2025
reflects a broad-based decrease in core inflation,
unlike the situation in 2023, when headline inflation fell mainly because of lower fuel prices. Core
inflation is expected to drop by 1.3 percentage
points in 2024, following a 0.1 percentage point

decrease in 2023, with advanced economies leading
this decline. Factors contributing to lower core inflation include the delayed effect of tight monetary
policies as well as diminishing pass-through effects
from earlier declines in prices, especially in those for
energy.
Overall, returning inflation to target is expected
to take until 2025 in most cases. Although the
pace of disinflation for the median economy has
been faster than expected in October 2023, the
dispersion across economies is now expected to be
larger. Comparison of official inflation targets with
the latest forecasts for a representative group of
inflation-targeting advanced and emerging market
economies suggests that annual average inflation will
exceed targets (or the midpoints of target ranges)
in more than three-quarters of these economies in
2025 (Figure 1.13, panel 2). But a great deal of this
reflects annual carryover effects from 2024. Inflation is expected to decline steadily on a sequential

basis, and by the end of 2025, most economies are
expected to be either at target or within a stone’s
throw of it.

Medium-Term Outlook: A Low-Growth
Regime Setting In
Absent a strong drive for structural reforms, output
growth is expected to remain weak over the medium
term (see Chapter 3 of the April 2024 World Economic
Outlook).
Although monetary policy is expected to return to
a neutral stance by 2025 in the world’s largest economies, growth in most economies is expected to remain
feeble over the medium term. For many advanced
and emerging market economies, the five-year-ahead
forecast is weaker than the one-year-ahead forecast
(Figure 1.14), suggesting that persistent headwinds to
growth will remain prevalent over the medium term.
Structural challenges such as population aging,
weak investment, and historically low total factor
productivity growth are still holding back global
growth. The five-year-ahead forecast for global growth
stands at 3.1 percent, indicating continued mediocre medium-term prospects relative to prepandemic
forecasts. Compared with those in April 2024, medium-term growth prospects for advanced economies
are unchanged. Although investment is expected to

CHAPTER 1

pick up and productivity growth is also expected to
see some normalization, the continued demographic
drag is likely to produce an offsetting effect. Cerdeiro,
Hong, and Kammer (2024) discuss underlying drivers
of recent productivity divergence between the United
States and euro area economies that may continue to
define medium-term growth trends in these economies.
For emerging market and developing economies,
medium-term growth prospects have not improved
compared with those in the April 2024 World Economic Outlook and are still much weaker than they
were in prepandemic projections. This partly reflects
prolonged scarring from the shocks of the past few
years, especially for low-income developing countries.
It also reflects a slower pace of structural reforms,
which is holding back productivity growth.
Projected slowdowns in the largest emerging market
and developing economies imply a longer path to close
the income gaps between poor and rich countries.
Having growth stuck in low gear could also further
exacerbate income inequality within economies. IMF
staff analysis suggests that periods of low economic
growth lasting four years or more tend to widen
income inequality within countries, because sluggish
job creation and wage growth—as well as weaker fiscal
positions preventing redistribution—tend to affect
low-income earners disproportionately (IMF 2024).

Trade Growth Historically Low, yet in Line with
Output Growth
Global trade is expected to continue to grow
in line with GDP, reaching an average of 3¼ percent growth annually in 2024 and 2025, following
a period of near stagnation in 2023. Despite an
increase in cross-border restrictions affecting trade
between geopolitically distant blocs, the global tradeto-GDP ratio is expected to remain stable. Intrabloc
trade and trade with third countries have been compensating forces so far.
Meanwhile, global current account balances––
the sums of absolute surpluses and deficits––are
expected to continue to decline from their 2022 peaks
(Figure 1.15). As reported in the IMF’s 2024 External
Sector Report, the significant moderation of current
account balances in 2023 toward prepandemic levels
reflected a reversal of large current account surpluses in
commodity-exporting countries, continued economic
recovery from the pandemic, and a slowdown in global
goods trade during 2023. Over the medium term,
global balances are expected to narrow gradually as

commodity prices decline. Creditor and debtor stock
positions reached historically elevated levels in 2022,
with the increases reflecting widening current account
balances. They are expected to moderate slightly over
the medium term as current account balances gradually
narrow. In some economies, gross external liabilities
remain large from a historical perspective and pose
risks of external stress.

Risks to the Outlook: Tilted to the
Downside
The most prominent risks and uncertainties
surrounding the outlook are now discussed. A model-based analysis that quantifies risks to the global
outlook and plausible scenarios—including shifts in
trade and fiscal policies—is presented in Box 1.2.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Since the July 2024 World Economic Outlook Update,
adverse risks have gained more prominence.
• Monetary policy tightening bites more than intended.
Although policy rates are projected to normalize,
an unanticipated back-loaded strengthening of the
transmission of earlier rate increases could lead to
a faster-than-anticipated deceleration in near-term
growth and rising unemployment. Though the
impact on growth is unlikely to be persistent given
concurrent policy easing, a rapid weakening of
activity could also work its way adversely through
consumer and business sentiment. This would place
a stronger drag on household spending and prompt
businesses to dial back their investment plans, either
(or both) of which could create a negative feedback
loop to growth. In such circumstances, however,
lower energy prices would cushion some of the negative effects on growth as lower demand would push
oil prices down.
• Financial markets reprice as a result of monetary
policy reassessments. The global economy is at the
last mile of disinflation, which may present greater
challenges to monetary policy than expected if
the cost of reducing inflation in terms of unemployment (the sacrifice ratio) is closer to prepandemic estimates than suggested by recent evidence
(Figure 1.3, panel 1). If underlying inflation
proves more persistent than expected, consumers
may adjust their near-term inflation expectations
(Figure 1.16), forcing central banks to adjust the
path of monetary policy normalization. This would
weaken consumer and business confidence, lead
to market repricing and tighter financial conditions, and slow economic recovery. Given existing
vulnerabilities (see Chapter 1 of the October 2024
Global Financial Stability Report), financial market
turbulence could resurge, prompting sizable price
corrections. Contagion effects are possible and
could increase risks to financial stability by, among
other things, triggering sovereign debt stress in
emerging markets.
• Sovereign debt stress intensifies in emerging market and
developing economies. Although spreads have eased
since peaking in July 2022, some emerging market
and developing economies are still vulnerable to a
repricing of risk. This could further increase their
sovereign spreads and push them into debt distress. Countries with large external financing needs

and a low buffer of international reserves will be
most affected, as many are already subject to large
sovereign borrowing spreads (Figure 1.7, panel 2).
With little room to maneuver on fiscal policy,
forcing a front-loaded fiscal consolidation could
precipitate an economic downturn amid a fragile
recovery. Low-income countries will be particularly
at risk given their limited fiscal space and the need
to maintain expenditure on programs supporting the
most vulnerable.
• China’s property sector contracts more deeply than
expected. Conditions for the real estate market
could worsen, with further price corrections taking
place amid a contraction in sales and investment.
The experiences of Japan in the 1990s and the
United States in 2008 suggest that a further price
correction is a plausible downside risk if the crisis is
not adequately addressed. Further price drops could
dent consumer confidence (which is already at historic lows) even more, further weakening household
consumption. This could cause domestic demand
to falter, with negative spillovers to both advanced
and emerging market economies given China’s
rising footprint in global trade (see Chapter 4
of the April 2024 World Economic Outlook).

CHAPTER 1

Government stimulus to counter weakness in
domestic demand would place further strain on
public finances. Subsidies in certain sectors, if
targeted to boost exports, could exacerbate trade
tensions with China’s trading partners.
• Renewed spikes in commodity prices arise as a result
of climate shocks, regional conflicts, or broader
geopolitical tensions. Intensification of regional
conflicts, especially given the wider span of conflict in the Middle East, or the war in Ukraine,
could further disrupt trade, leading to sustained
increases in food, energy, and other commodity
prices. Commodity price volatility may result in
higher inflation, especially for commodity-importing countries, and restrict central banks’ room to
maneuver. Extreme heat and prolonged droughts
amid record high temperatures worldwide could
also have an impact on harvests, adding to pressures on food prices and food security. Low-income countries are likely to be disproportionately
affected, since food and energy costs take up a
large part of household expenditures there.
• Countries ratchet up protectionist policies. A broadbased retreat from a rules-based global trading system is prompting many countries to take unilateral
actions. Not only would an intensification of protectionist policies exacerbate global trade tensions and
disrupt global supply chains, but it could also weigh
down medium-term growth prospects by limiting
positive spillovers from innovation and technology
transfer, which fueled growth in emerging market
and developing economies as globalization took off.
• Social unrest resumes. Reports of social unrest—
including protests, riots, and major demonstrations—have picked up in some regions, although
globally they remain fewer in number than the
recent peak in late 2019 to early 2020 (Figure 1.17).
However, a resurgence of social turmoil, potentially driven by higher inflation, higher taxes, and
associated loss of purchasing power; spillovers from
conflicts; and rising inequality, could slow economic
growth, particularly in countries with more limited scope to cushion the impact through policies
(Hadzi-Vaskov, Pienknagura, and Ricci 2023).
Social unrest could also complicate the passage and
implementation of necessary reforms. Chapter 3
emphasizes the crucial role of social consensus in
achieving successful and sustainable implementation
of structural reforms.

Upside Risks
More favorable outcomes for global growth than in
the baseline forecast are also plausible:
• Stronger recovery in investment in advanced economies:
Public investment in advanced economies could
accelerate to meet various pressing policy objectives,
from the green transition to upgrading infrastructure
and boosting investment in science and technology.
This type of investment could also crowd in the
private sector, increasing private investment, and
lead to a higher-than-projected recovery in global
demand and trade. Higher aggregate demand could
be inflationary, although the pressure could be
mitigated by the extent to which these investments
enhance supply-side capacity (see Chapter 3 of the
October 2022 World Economic Outlook). It also
depends on how these investments are financed:
fiscal slippage in advanced economies could further
slow the pace at which central banks can bring
inflation to target.
• Stronger momentum of structural reforms: Many
advanced and emerging market economies may
accelerate structural reform efforts to prevent productivity and potential growth from further lagging
those of their more productive peers. Faster implementation of macro-critical structural reforms to

increase labor force participation (such as measures
to better integrate immigrants and women), to
reduce misallocation in labor and capital markets,
or to help stimulate business innovations (Arnold,
Claveres, and Frie 2024) could lead to higher medium-term growth.

Policy Priorities: From Restoring Price
Stability to Rebuilding Buffers
Near-term policies should be carefully calibrated
and sequenced to ensure a smooth landing. As central
banks adopt a less restrictive stance, a renewed emphasis on medium-term fiscal consolidation is urgent. This
is necessary to restore budgetary flexibility, fund priority investments, and ensure long-term debt sustainability. If inflation descends and approaches targets, central
banks should also take into account the implications of
monetary policy for growth and employment, as long
as it does not undermine the goal of achieving price
stability. Easing monetary policy, while still keeping
inflation and inflation expectations on a downward
path to target, would support growth and employment and also ease debt-servicing costs. This would
in turn facilitate fiscal consolidation in a favorable
feedback loop in which tighter fiscal policy paves the
way for looser monetary policy. Implementing robust
supply-enhancing reforms would help curb inflation
and reduce debt, enabling economies to boost growth
toward prepandemic rates, and accelerate progress
toward higher income standards. Multilateral cooperation is essential to limit the costs and risks associated
with geoeconomic fragmentation and climate change,
speed up the transition to green energy, and support
debt restructuring.

Ensuring a Smooth Landing
With output gaps gradually closing and inflation
on a downward trajectory and approaching targets
in many countries, the priority should be to ensure
a smooth landing. Monetary policy should remain
flexible and adjust based on a comprehensive analysis
of incoming data and their implications for growth
and inflation projections. As before, the focus should
be to keep short- and long-term inflation expectations
anchored. The varying pace of disinflation and monetary easing across advanced and emerging market and
developing economies could trigger great exchange rate
volatility, necessitating the use of alternative instru-

ments in some cases. In particular cases, when risk-off
episodes translate into higher borrowing costs—putting
financial sectors under more stress—the importance of
close supervision and comfortable buffers cannot be
overstated.
• Carefully calibrate monetary policy. Monetary policy
needs to be carefully calibrated to ensure the restoration of price stability while supporting growth
and employment. In economies with core inflation
persistently above target, it is crucial to maintain a
restrictive stance, keeping real interest rates above
the neutral level until there is clear evidence of
sustained cooling in underlying inflation. This
approach is vital to preserving the achievements of
many central banks in anchoring long-term inflation
expectations. Where underlying inflation is diminishing consistently, in sync with inflation expectations, a transition to a more neutral policy stance
would be warranted. In such cases, the policy rate
can be dropped gradually to avoid undue increases
in real interest rates. When the economy cools down
faster than expected, and to the extent that inflation
remains under control and on a downward path to
target, real rates could be reduced to support growth
and employment and keep output close to potential,
accounting for lags in the transmission of monetary
policy. Throughout this process, it is important to
communicate consistently a commitment to price
stability.
• Mitigate disruptive foreign exchange volatility. As
countries follow different paths to disinflation,
central bank policies may become less synchronized,
potentially leading to increased capital flows. For
instance, US inflation that is more persistent than
expected could elevate interest rate expectations,
causing the US dollar to appreciate. This would
push up domestic prices in economies with higher
import dependence and greater shares of dollar-invoiced imports, potentially exerting pressure on
their financial sectors (Gopinath and Gourinchas
2022; Adrian, Natalucci, and Wu 2024). The IMF’s
Integrated Policy Framework offers country-specific
guidance on appropriate policy responses in such
scenarios. For countries with deep foreign exchange
markets and low foreign currency debt, adjusting
policy rates and allowing exchange rate flexibility are
advisable. When market stress arises, rapid and decisive use of tools to provide liquidity support, while
avoiding moral hazard, can help limit contagion. In
contrast, for countries with shallow foreign exchange

CHAPTER 1

Rebuilding Fiscal Buffers while Avoiding
Debt Distress
Fiscal deficits and government debt are still above
what they were before the pandemic, and debt-service costs remain high and rising in many countries.
To ensure debt sustainability and restore long-term
budgetary flexibility, it is important for many countries, including both advanced and emerging market
economies, to tighten fiscal policy (Figure 1.18). In
countries where inflation remains elevated, fiscal consolidation can also reduce aggregate demand and help

markets or substantial foreign currency debt, tightening global financial conditions might trigger a
rise in risk premiums and lead to “taper tantrums”
as investors offload domestic currency assets, posing
systemic risks to financial stability and growth
uncertainties. In these situations, while maintaining
suitable monetary and fiscal policies, temporary
foreign exchange interventions or capital flow management measures could be appropriate. Macroprudential measures should help mitigate financial
vulnerabilities stemming from large foreign-currency-denominated debt exposures. When sharp
exchange rate movements threaten to de-anchor
inflation expectations, temporary foreign exchange
interventions may support monetary policy, provided sufficient reserves are available and the cost of
using monetary policy alone is excessive. Countries
vulnerable to external shocks could consider using
the global financial safety nets provided by international financial institutions, such as precautionary
financial arrangements from the IMF.
• Restore macroprudential buffers and ensure financial
stability. With borrowing costs still higher than
before the pandemic, it is crucial to carefully monitor
serious misalignments in financing conditions and
strengthen supervision. This includes implementing
Basel III reforms to protect the financial system from
potential repercussions of a sudden repricing of risk
and anticipating stress in the banking sector. Where
feasible, macroprudential buffers deployed during the
pandemic and the 2021 global energy crisis should be
gradually rebuilt in the context of a rapidly evolving
real estate market. In the event of market strains,
central banks should be prepared to deploy necessary financial stability tools, providing prompt and
forceful liquidity support to limit contagion (Adrian,
Gopinath, and Gourinchas 2023).

ease overall inflationary pressures. For countries with
limited fiscal space, the reallocation of spending toward
initiatives that support and enhance productivity and
competitiveness can stimulate economic growth and
release some of the pressure on overall spending. It is,
however, important to ensure continuous support to
the most vulnerable during fiscal consolidation, safeguarding key social spending and safety nets. Strong
commitments, clearly defined medium-term fiscal policy plans, clear communication of objectives and policy
rationale, and careful sequencing (see Chapter 3) are
essential to maintain popular support, credibility, and
confidence; prevent disruptive market reactions; and
ensure debt sustainability.
• Urgently devise credible fiscal plans to avoid disruptive
adjustments. Restoring depleted fiscal buffers requires
a consolidation path that is carefully calibrated
to country-specific economic conditions. Unduly
delaying consolidation may lead to market-imposed
disruptive adjustments, while excessively front-loading the adjustments may end up hurting economic
activity and putting an undue burden on vulnerable members in the society. Where consolidation
is necessary, its pace should be gradual and well
communicated to avoid abrupt adjustments that
could diminish economic activity, trigger spikes
in debt ratios, and undermine public support for

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

19

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

fiscal plans. In certain cases, front-loading fiscal
adjustments may be necessary to alleviate stress
on sovereign debt, particularly in economies that
have already lost or are about to lose market access.
To achieve lasting consolidation, a credible medium-term plan is essential. This plan should signal
a commitment to and identify measures sufficient
for meeting medium-term targets based on realistic assumptions about interest rates, revenues and
spending, and the growth effects of the consolidation. In addition, it is critical for the plan’s credibility to put a strong institutional framework in place,
including binding legislation and fiscal frameworks
to support medium-term consolidation plans.
• Safeguard growth-enhancing measures while reducing
inequality. During fiscal consolidation, it is crucial to
maintain a growth-friendly approach to adjustments
while mitigating the adverse impacts of consolidation
on poverty and inequality, which could help increase
social acceptability and gather political support.
Continuing public investments, particularly in areas
that boost productivity and competitiveness—such as
public and digital infrastructure—can yield positive
growth (Figure 1.19). In addition, implementing
structural reforms to reduce market inefficiencies
and increase labor supply can amplify the benefits of
these growth-friendly investments. Key elements for
a well-designed consolidation plan will vary across
countries (see the October 2024 Fiscal Monitor).
• Ensure debt sustainability. Many countries, particularly emerging market economies and low-income
countries, have stretched their ability to service their
debt with borrowing costs and sovereign spreads
still elevated and therefore require significant fiscal
adjustments to ensure government debt sustainability (see the October 2024 Fiscal Monitor). In
instances in which countries are in or at high risk
of debt distress, achieving debt sustainability may
require not only well-timed fiscal consolidation, but
also debt restructuring (see Chapter 3 of the April
2023 World Economic Outlook). Recent progress in
improving international sovereign debt resolution
frameworks, including the Group of Twenty (G20)
Common Framework and the Global Sovereign
Debt Roundtable, is helping bring together debtors
and creditors and facilitate predictable restructuring.
It is critical to continue building on these initiatives
and improve the efficiency of creditor coordination
in cases that are not eligible for treatment under the
Common Framework.

Engineering Faster Medium-Term Growth and
Combating Climate Change
To boost productivity and resolve key structural
bottlenecks, targeted reforms are vital in areas that
include health care, education, labor markets, competition, and digitalization. Effective and clear communication to garner consensus and stakeholder engagement
is essential for successful implementation of these
reforms. In some countries, first-generation reforms
aimed at revitalizing domestic markets and opening up
economies, including governance reforms to strengthen
institutions, could have a significant impact on growth
(Budina and others 2023).
• Advance macrostructural reforms. Carefully sequenced
reforms targeting long-term structural weaknesses are crucial for reviving productivity growth
and attracting infrastructure and human capital,

CHAPTER 1

especially when fiscal space is limited. This is
increasingly important as medium-term growth
prospects continue to weaken. Key reforms include
enhancing human capital by expanding health care
coverage and increasing access to early childhood
and higher education, with a focus on affordability and quality; reducing labor market rigidity
and increasing labor force participation, especially
among women; reducing barriers to competition
and supporting start-ups; and advancing digitalization. By accelerating growth, such reforms can also
alleviate concerns about potential short-term growth
costs of the transition to clean energy (see Chapter 3
of the October 2022 World Economic Outlook) and
create the necessary fiscal space for implementation.
Given the historical challenges in passing structural
reforms, policymakers should engage in active and
effective communication to build consensus. It
is vital to design policy measures thoughtfully to
ensure that reforms are sustainable and their benefits
are widely shared. This includes early engagement
with key stakeholders during policy design and
crafting complementary and compensatory measures
that consider the potential distributional effects of
the reforms. Continuous engagement and robust
institutions can help build trust (see Chapter 3).
• Accelerate the green transition and address climate
change. Comprehensive and global policy actions
are required to meet greenhouse gas reduction
goals aiming to limit global temperature increases
to 1.5–2.0°C above preindustrial levels. Carbon
pricing, subsidies for green investments, and carbon border-adjustment mechanisms can support
the green transition while maintaining consistency
with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
Green industrial policies in China, the United
States, and the European Union, among others,
should be designed to complement carbon pricing and avoid discriminatory elements and to be
fully consistent with international law obligations
of these countries. Significant emissions cuts are
achievable by helping firms with high emissions
per unit of output adopt frontier technologies.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

To reduce long-term energy security risks, scaling
back fossil fuel investments should be matched
by increases in clean energy supplies. In addition,
investments in climate adaptation and infrastructure are essential, particularly for regions
most vulnerable to climate shocks. Improving
climate-risk-monitoring systems and risk management frameworks and strengthening safety nets and
insurance are necessary to build climate resilience.
Mobilizing climate finance for both adaptation and
mitigation in low-income countries will require
coordinated efforts by international organizations,
private investors, country authorities, and donors
(see the October 2023 Fiscal Monitor).
• Strengthen multilateral cooperation. Multilateral
cooperation is essential in preventing fragmentation, sustaining economic growth and stability, and
addressing climate change. Trade policies should be
clear and transparent to stabilize expectations, lessen
investment distortions, and reduce volatility in
markets, including those for agricultural and critical
mineral commodities. To combat climate change,
establishing a “green corridor” agreement will secure
the flow of critical minerals essential for the green
transition, and increased sharing of data on these
minerals can reduce uncertainty and price volatility.
Industrial policies could be envisaged to address
well-established negative externalities or market
failures that horizontal policies cannot tackle.
However, industrial policies should be well designed,
with benefits greater than costs, and should protect
fiscal sustainability and external stability. These
policies should avoid protectionist measures and
remain compliant with WTO agreements. Promoting a common platform for the transfer of
low-carbon technologies to emerging market and
developing economies and to regulate disruptive
technologies such as artificial intelligence can help
reduce emissions and foster global prosperity. In this
context, priorities should be restoring a fully and
well-functioning WTO dispute settlement system
and achieving greater clarity and coherence between
climate considerations and trade rules.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Box 1.1. The Global Automotive Industry and the Shift to Electric Vehicles
The rising adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)
represents a fundamental transformation of the global
automotive industry. It will have far-reaching consequences for patterns of investment, production, international trade, and employment. This box documents
some key steps in the evolution of the automotive
sector and charts possible economic and regional
implications.
The car industry stands out among manufacturing
sectors in several ways. First, it is very capital intensive,
with high investment (including for innovation), and
a significant capital share is value added. The sector
relies on skilled labor and pays wages that reflect the
high value added per worker (Figure 1.1.1, panel 1).
Second, multinational firms in the sector operate in
many countries along deep global value chains measured by the share of foreign value added in production (Figure 1.1.1, panel 2). Finally, despite having
many competitors, carmakers manage to have effective
product differentiation and extract a sizable share of
the consumer surplus, particularly at the top end.
With the sector having high wages, showing strong
profits, using a high degree of technology, and having
large export markets, many countries see it as strategic.
In 2022, the transportation sector generated
36 percent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
the United States, 21 percent in the European Union,
and 8 percent in China (IEA 2024b). Emissions from
transportation have failed to decline at the same pace
as those from electricity generation and industry in the
past 15 years. Therefore, the shift to electric vehicles
for personal transportation is a key part of the reduction of GHG emissions. To foster the adoption of
EVs, both supply- and demand-side policies have been
implemented across the world (IEA 2024a).
On the demand side, the European Union has set
out an ambitious goal of reducing emissions from
cars by 50 percent for 2030–35 from the 2021 levels
in its “Fit for 55” package. In the United States, the
Inflation Reduction Act includes subsidies for EV
purchases and the deployment of charging stations.
Supply-side policies aim at closing the cost and
convenience gaps between EVs and conventional
internal combustion engine vehicles, which is a key
obstacle to a widespread adoption of EVs. Policies
are targeting the entire EV value chain: vehicles,
batteries, and extraction and processing of metals.

Wingender.

Cost reduction relies on two main pillars: innovation
and increasing returns to scale. It explains the global
race for innovation in EVs among large carmakers
and battery manufacturers that resulted in the rise of
many newcomers in the United States (Lucid, Rivian,
Tesla) and even more in China (BYD, Geely, Wuling,
and the like). The rise of lithium ion battery manufacturers has been even faster, as the industry started
only 25 years ago.
As a result of policies and technological breakthroughs in batteries, the global transition from
conventional vehicles to EVs has accelerated in
recent years (Figure 1.1.2, panel 1) and comes with a
redistribution of comparative advantages. In particular,
the role of China in both production and exports has

dramatically increased compared with that 15 years
ago (Figure 1.1.2, panels 2 and 3).
The EV transition will have global and regional
macroeconomic implications. An IMF working paper
(Wingender and others 2024) estimates the macroeconomic implications of a policy-driven shift to EVs
in the European Union by 2035. Two main channels
are at play: (1) regulation moves demand away from
conventional vehicles and toward EVs, and (2) China
continues to enjoy a relative cost advantage in building
EVs. Under realistic EV market penetration scenarios,
GDP in Europe is reduced by about 0.3 percent in
the medium term. In these scenarios, employment
declines in the automotive sector, and labor reallocates
gradually to less capital-intensive sectors (with lower
value added per worker).
The analysis also emphasizes that the ability to
import EVs from China softens the trade-offs between
economic and climate goals. With fewer imported
EVs, climate policies have to be more stringent to
reach the same climate goal, and households’ purchasing power is reduced. Imports of EVs also redistribute
gains and losses between countries specializing in car
manufacturing (losing market share) and net car-importing countries (gaining purchasing power). The EV
transition will have implications beyond car manufacturing: for the energy sector, for instance, with a shift
from gasoline to electricity to fuel car fleets, or for
demand for minerals.

Box 1.2. Risk Assessment Surrounding the World Economic Outlook’s

Risks to growth are currently considered moderately
tilted to the downside. The risk of global growth falling below 2 percent—an outcome that has occurred
only five times since 1970—in 2025 is now assessed at
17 percent, compared with 12 percent in April, in part
because the risk of a recession in the United States
has increased moderately. Risks for global inflation are
considered broadly balanced.

Confidence Bands

2023

The G20 model (Andrle and others 2015) is
used here to interpret historical data and recover
the implied economic shocks. The shocks are then
sampled and fed back through the model to generate
predictive distributions. Unlike in the April 2024
World Economic Outlook, shocks from years in which
US recessions took place are sampled more frequently
when constructing the confidence bands for 2025 and
2026 projections. The approach reflects the assessment
that US recession risks have increased somewhat in
the near term on account of labor market developments.1 Data from five recessions are oversampled:
those in 1969, 1982, 1990, 2001, and 2008. Shocks
for all countries are also oversampled for those years to
exploit possible co-movements in the data.
Panels 1–3 in Figure 1.2.1 show the distributions
for US growth, headline inflation, and the federal
funds rate, respectively. The probability of US growth
falling below 0.8 percent in 2025—corresponding to
a short-lived US recession starting in the fourth quarter of 2024—is about 25 percent. That is a modest
increase from the risk of recession in the April 2024
World Economic Outlook (17 percent). The risk of
average US headline inflation falling below 1.5 percent in 2025 is assessed at about 40 percent; the risk
of the federal funds rate falling below 3 percent for
2025 is about 28 percent.

Kindberg-Hanlon, Dirk Muir, and Rafael Portillo.
1The implications of greater recession risks for the distribution
of 2024 growth are not considered, because the first-half outturn
is already known and a hypothetical recession would start in the
fourth quarter at the earliest.

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2 (continued)
The probability of global growth in 2025 falling
below 2 percent is assessed at about 17 percent. The
probabilities of global measures of average headline
and core inflation falling below 3 percent in 2025
are estimated at about 20 percent and 15 percent,
respectively.

Scenarios
The G20 and GIMF models are then used to
simulate two scenarios, each consisting of various
layers. Scenario A is considered a plausible downside
alternative to the current baseline. Scenario B looks at
policies advocated to address existing imbalances in the
world economy. If implemented, policies in scenario
B could reduce the likelihood of policies in scenario
A materializing. Both scenarios assume endogenous
monetary and fiscal policy responses (automatic stabilizers). It is also assumed that exchange rate stability
plays a role in China’s monetary policy.2
Scenario A has five layers:
A global increase in tariffs. Trade tensions lead to a
permanent increase in tariffs starting in mid-2025 and
affecting a sizable swath of global trade. The United
States, the euro area, and China impose a 10 percent tariff on trade flows among the three regions; a
10 percent tariff is also levied on trade flows (in both
directions) between the United States and the rest of
the world. The increase in tariffs directly affects about
one-quarter of all goods trade, representing close to 6
percent of global GDP.3 The revenue generated by the
tariffs is transferred back to households.
Greater trade policy uncertainty. US tariff hikes
in 2018–19 increased uncertainty over future trade
policies and adversely affected investment, especially
in manufacturing. In scenario A, the tariff increases
similarly raise trade policy uncertainty from mid-2025
onward.4 It is assumed that US aggregate investment
declines by about 4 percent relative to the baseline,
2The GIMF model is used for scenario A, as it is better suited
for the analysis of tariffs and provides a more detailed treatment
of corporate taxes (Anderson and others 2013; Carton, Fernandez-Corugedo, and Hunt 2019). Scenario B uses the G20 model.
3Tariff scenarios were analyzed in the World Economic Outlook
in 2018 and 2019. The share of global trade affected by higher
tariffs here is about four times larger than in those scenarios. The
increase in tariffs is smaller (about one-third of those there).
4See, for example, Caldara and others (2020). Chapter 2 of
the October 2024 Global Financial Stability Report provides an
in-depth discussion of various measures of uncertainty and of the
channels through which they affect activity.

about twice the estimated effect from the previous episode. The increase in uncertainty is global. The euro
area experiences a decrease in investment similar to
that in the United States, and other regions, including
China, experience a hit that is about half as large. The
impact on investment fades starting in 2027.
Taxation of business income in the United States.
Many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (TCJA) relating to the taxation of business
income are due to expire at the end of 2025, leading
to less generous depreciation allowances and raising
the effective tax rate for some businesses. Scenario
A assumes these expiring provisions are renewed for
10 years, lowering business income taxes by about
4.0 percent of baseline GDP, cumulatively, between
2025 and 2034.
Migration flows to the United States and Europe.
Migration has been boosting labor force growth in
advanced economies in recent years, raising potential output and reducing inflationary pressures, most
notably in the United States. Whereas a normalization
is projected in the World Economic Outlook baseline for
both the United States and the euro area, scenario A
assumes further reductions in net migration, starting
in 2025. As a result, the US labor force is permanently
reduced by 1 percent by 2030 and the euro area labor
force by 0.75 percent, relative to the baseline.
Global financial conditions. Three factors result
in a moderate tightening in financial conditions in
2025–26. First, the scenario has a negative impact on
the world economy, trade, and uncertainty. Second,
US monetary policy is (endogenously) tighter than in
the baseline, because of a (small) net increase in US
inflation. Third, debt increases further, more so in the
United States, adding to concerns about debt sustainability. As a result of these factors, sovereign premiums
in emerging markets (excluding China) increase by
50 basis points, while corporate premiums increase by
50 basis points in advanced economies and China and
100 basis points in other emerging markets. Term premiums also increase by 40 basis points in the United
States and by 25 basis points in the euro area.
Scenario B has two layers:
Rebalancing in China. Reforms are implemented
that strengthen China’s social safety net by expanding
coverage and increasing accessibility of social security
benefits. As a result, the private saving rate gradually
falls relative to the baseline starting in 2025 and is
3 percentage points of GDP lower by 2027. The saving

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Box 1.2 (continued)
rate gradually converges back to the baseline starting in
2030.
Higher EU public investment. Subdued productivity growth and ambitious green transition goals
have underscored the need for higher investment in
Europe, most recently advocated in the European
Commission’s “The Future of European Competitiveness.” In scenario B, countries in the European
Union undertake a region-wide expansion in public
investment, which increases by 1.5 percent of the
region’s baseline GDP on average during 2025–30
and remains permanently higher by 0.5 percent of
baseline GDP after that, to sustain higher public
capital. About half of the surge is financed by higher
deficits and the rest by a reallocation of government
spending.

Impact on World Output and Inflation
Figures 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 present the effects for scenarios A and B. Panel 1 in each figure shows the effects on
the level of GDP during 2024–30 for three economies
(China, United States, euro area) and for the world.
Panel 2 shows the effects for inflation. Effects on GDP
are presented as percent deviations from the baseline,
whereas effects on headline inflation are presented as
percentage point deviations from the baseline.5
In scenario A, the increase in tariffs affects activity in
all regions. Imposing tariffs on imports raises domestic input costs, and higher tariffs on exports lower
external demand. The net effect on inflation depends
on the relative strength of these two channels but is
small. There is a small negative impact on investment;
the impact on consumption is limited, because tariff
revenue is transferred back to households. Across
regions, the impact on the United States is larger,
because US trade flows are subject in their entirety to
the new tariffs: GDP falls by 0.4 percent in 2025 and
by 0.6 percent in 2026. The impact on other regions
and the world reaches –0.3 percent of GDP by 2026,
and global imports and exports also fall by about
4 percent, relative to the baseline. The effects on GDP
are permanent, however. The trade policy uncertainty
layer has a more immediate impact on global activity. Global investment (not shown) falls by close to
2 percent by 2026, lowering GDP by 0.4 percent over
the same period, while global inflation falls by 10 basis
points.
5The impact on growth rates can be approximated by subtracting the effects on output from the previous year.

The temporary renewal of US TCJA provisions
raises US investment by about 2 percent in 2025 and
4 percent in 2026, relative to the baseline. US GDP
increases by 0.4 percent, and inflation increases by an
average of 20 basis points over 2025–30, prompting
higher US policy rates. Spillovers to other regions
are negative as investment demand decreases slightly
outside the United States. The decrease in migration
flows to the United States and euro area permanently
reduces potential output in both regions and raises
inflation along the adjustment path. GDP falls by
0.5 percent in the United States and by 0.4 percent in
the euro area in 2025, whereas inflation increases by
about 20 basis points and 15 basis points for the two,
respectively. As domestic demand falls in the United
States and the euro area, GDP in the rest of the world
also dips. Finally, the tightening in global financial conditions reduces activity globally, more so in emerging
markets excluding China (not shown).
The combined effect of scenario A is a decrease
in global GDP of about 0.8 percent by 2025 and
1.3 percent by 2026, relative to the baseline, with
some of the effects fading over time. US GDP falls by
about 1 percent relative to the baseline in 2025. The
impact on global inflation is by contrast muted, at
–10 basis points by 2026, reflecting the role of both
demand and supply factors in the scenario.
In scenario B, the China rebalancing layer generates an increase in China’s domestic absorption. The
positive effect on China’s GDP peaks at 2.5 percent
by 2027 relative to the baseline, and headline inflation
increases by 90 basis points in 2025 and by as much
as 140 basis points in 2027. The rebalancing reduces
China’s current account by more than 1 percent of
GDP and benefits global activity, but the effect on
inflation outside China is small. The EU public investment layer steadily raises the level of GDP in the euro
area, which peaks at 2.5 percent above the baseline by
2030. Productivity increases, raising private investment and potential output and limiting inflationary
pressures: inflation is about 40 basis points higher than
the baseline over 2025–30. Spillovers to other regions
are small. The combined effect of layers in scenario B
is a 0.5 percent increase in world GDP and a rise of
30 basis points in headline inflation in 2025.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Commodity Special Feature: Market Developments and the
Inflationary Effects of Metal Supply Shocks
Primary commodity prices increased between February
and August 2024, driven by natural gas, precious
metal, and beverage prices. In oil markets, supply cuts
by OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries plus selected nonmember countries, including Russia) and geopolitical tensions in the Middle
East offset strong non-OPEC+ supply growth. Beverage
prices continued their ascent, which was driven by the
impact of El Niño on tropical crops. Gold prices soared
owing to geopolitical uncertainty and rising anticipation
of rate cuts. This Special Feature analyzes the role of
metals in the economy and their impact on inflation.1

Oil prices steadied between February and August
2024 amid OPEC+ production cuts and Middle East
tensions. Before weakening in September, oil prices
held steady, with oil trading in a range of $75 to $90
a barrel between February and August, averaging $83
a barrel. Oil demand growth for this year was expected
to match its 21st century average, but this forecast
was surrounded by great uncertainty (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 3).2 Deep production cuts by OPEC+, totaling
5.86 million barrels per day (mb/d), have put a floor
on prices, partially offsetting strong output growth in
non-OPEC+ countries, led by Canada, Guyana, and
the United States (Figure 1SF.1, panel 4).
Fears of a broader regional escalation of tensions in
the Middle East have added a volatile risk premium
to oil prices, though no major supply disruptions have
occurred so far. A rise in Red Sea maritime attacks
has dislocated seaborne oil flows, decreasing traffic
through the Suez Canal by almost two-thirds and
largely rerouting it around the Cape of Good Hope,
though tanker rates for both products and crude oil

2As of its September reports, the International Energy Agency
forecasts 0.90 million barrels a day (mb/d) in average demand
growth for 2024, compared with OPEC’s 2.00 mb/d, the US Energy
Information Administration’s 0.94 mb/d, and Consensus Economics’
polling of 0.75 mb/d. Most of the discrepancy relates to the pace
of demand growth in economies outside of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.

have dropped back to pre-conflict prices. Russian oil,
exported primarily to China and India, has been trading above the Group of Seven price cap for most of the
past year—but at a $15–$20 discount to Brent.
Futures markets suggest that prices will rise by
0.9 percent year over year to average $81.3 a barrel in
2024 and then fall to $67.0 in 2029 (Figure 1.SF.1,
panel 2). Risks to this outlook are tilted to the
downside. Upside price risks from an escalation of the
Middle East conflict or from a prolonged extension
of OPEC+ cuts are outweighed by risks of weaker
oil demand in China and the United States—which
collectively account for almost 40 percent of global
demand—as well as in Japan and other advanced
economies, and a rise in OPEC+ production to regain
market share.
Natural gas prices rose because of weather and supply
concerns. Title Transfer Facility (TTF) trading hub
prices in Europe rose 26.4 percent between February
and August to $10.2 a million British thermal units
(MMBtu), though they remain well below their peak in
2022. Price increases were driven by warmer-than-expected summer weather in the Northern Hemisphere and a potential cutoff from Russia’s remaining
Europe-destined pipeline gas. Subdued economic
activity in the European Union and high storage levels
capped further price increases. For liquefied natural gas,
Asian prices increased by 49.8 percent following strong
import demand from Japan and especially China and
India, and US Henry Hub prices rose by 16.8 percent.
Futures markets suggest that TTF prices will average
$10.4/MMBtu in 2024, decreasing to $8.2/MMBtu in
2029. Henry Hub prices may rise from $2.3/MMBtu in
2024 to $3.6/MMBtu in 2029, as US export capacity
is expected to almost double through 2027, according
to the US Energy Information Administration. Risks to
this outlook are balanced.
Metals prices increased. The IMF’s metals price
index increased by 7.7 percent between February and
August 2024 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1). Gold prices
surged by 21.9 percent to record highs against the US
dollar, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, expectations
of US rate cuts, and past US consumer price index
(CPI) inflation. Conversely, iron ore prices fell by
19.9 percent, affected by reduced demand from the
steel and construction sectors in China. Copper (aluminum) prices soared by 8.1 (7.8) percent, reaching a
record nominal high in early July, fueled by growing
demand from renewable energy sources, electricity
grids, electric vehicles, and data centers. However,
starting in July, both copper and aluminum prices

retrenched on account of weaker demand projections
from China.
Agricultural commodity prices declined. Between February and August 2024, the IMF’s food and beverages
price index decreased slightly, by 2.4 percent, as large
price increases for beverages were more than offset by
decreases in prices for other food categories. Cereal
prices declined by 14.3 percent, with global grain production forecast to reach a record high over marketing
year (MY) 2024–25. Cocoa prices increased by 20.4
percent, peaking at a record high in April, in line with
expectations by the International Cocoa Organization
of an 11 percent decline in global cocoa supply for
MY 2023–24 on account of El Niño and crop diseases
in West Africa. Coffee prices rallied, rising by 33.8 percent, following weather-related supply concerns in key
producers Brazil and Vietnam. Rice prices declined by
7.5 percent, retreating from a multiyear peak reached
in January of this year, as crop conditions improved in
India and other parts of Asia. Upside risks stem from
further trade disruptions in the Black Sea and new
food export restrictions. Larger-than-expected harvests
constitute the most important downside risk.

Metals Matter: The Economic Relevance
of Critical Inputs
Since the end of World War II, oil has played a
major role, among commodities, as a source of shocks
for the global economy and inflation (see, for example,
Hamilton 1983; and Kilian 2008, 2009). However, the
shift from fossil fuels to metals as inputs to energy systems may render the global economy less oil intensive
and relatively more metals intensive (Boer, Pescatori,
and Stuermer 2024). The International Energy Agency
predicts that demand for copper may grow by a factor
of more than 1.5, and the consumption of oil could
decline by 25 percent by 2030 in a net zero emissions
scenario (Figure 1.SF.2; IEA 2022).
At the same time, metals production could become
less reliable because of geopolitical tensions. Since
most metals production is geographically concentrated
(more so than that of oil) and most metals are not easily substitutable, trade disruptions could lead to sharp
swings in prices, with a growing economic impact as
the global economy and energy systems become more
reliant on metals (Alvarez and others 2023).3
3New trade restrictions, including those on metals trade, have
almost doubled since the start of the war in Ukraine (Gopinath and
others 2024).

Note: We assume that consumption equals production in 1970–2020.

Employing time series econometrics and a quantitative production network model, this Special Feature
investigates how metals are used in an economy and
how they affect fluctuations in inflation, using oil as a
comparator.

Metals Embodied in Investment Goods
Primary metals are embodied in the production of
investment goods in a different way than oil is. In fact,
even as metals like copper and aluminum represent only
a small fraction of final consumption expenditure (for
example, 0.01 percent against 2.6 percent for oil and
coal products in the United States), they are critical direct
intermediate inputs into the production of investment
goods. For example, metals represent more than 10
percent of direct input expenditure in US sectors for electrical equipment and machinery (Figure 1.SF.3, panel 1).
Because metals are embodied in investment goods,
they are also indirect inputs. For example, to produce
vehicles, metals are used not only for the body of the
car, but also for the machines used to assemble the car.
To capture these indirect effects, a production network
model with flexible prices (for example, Balke and
Wynne 2000) is used.
As shown later empirically, the fact that key upstream
sectors providing capital are highly exposed to metals
implies a slower and more persistent response of inflation to metals price shocks. In contrast, gas and petroleum products are much less embodied in machines
and investment goods. Instead, they are used chiefly as

Note: “Direct” is sectoral intermediate input expenditure of metals (oil) as a share of
sectoral gross output. “Indirect” is Leontief inverse share element minus “Direct.”
The Domar weight is the ratio of the nominal value of each industry’s gross output to
GDP and is expressed by the bubble size. The highest Domar weight is for construction
(9.59 percent), and the lowest is for water transportation (0.03 percent). We define the
metals sector as the sum of the non-oil and non-gas mining sector and the primary
metals sector. The oil sector is the sum of the oil and gas mining sector and the
petroleum manufacturing sector. equip. = equipment; excl. = excluding; Misc. =
miscellaneous; transp. = transportation; Elec. = electrical; Fab. = fabricated.

fuel to produce energy, mostly in transportation (air,
water, truck, rail) and utilities (Figure 1.SF.3, panel 2).
This makes the effect of an oil price shock on headline
inflation more immediate. Once the indirect component
is considered, fabricated metals and machinery stand
out, with 28 percent and 46 percent shares, respectively,
for the United States (Figure 1.SF.3, panel 1). Shares are
also sizable for motor vehicles and electrical equipment
and appliances.

Metals Are Important in Many Countries’
Production Networks
The relevance of metals in the production network
is even more pronounced in some countries than
in the United States. Figure 1.SF.4 plots the (total
input-output network) exposure to metals and oil,

at the aggregate level, for the top 25 countries, using
input-output data from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.4 Panel 1 aggregates
sectoral exposures to metals and oil using value-added
shares, which are suited for use in gauging the exposure of an economy to metals and oil on the production
side. Panel 2 shows the exposure to metals and oil
on the consumption side. It uses final consumption
expenditure shares, the relevant measure for CPI, to
construct the consumption exposure, which indicates
the percent increase in the CPI of a country following a 10 percent negative supply shock that results in
about a 15 (16) percent increase in metals (oil) prices,
on average, across countries.
4The data cover 45 sectors for 2018 and include imports of intermediates, which are sizable in the case of metals and oil.

Several results stand out from Figure 1.SF.4. First,
the heterogeneity in the exposure of production is
starker than the one in the exposure of consumption
across countries. This is because consumption preferences are likely similar across countries, leading to less
heterogeneity in consumption exposure. At the same
time, the location of production of tradable goods is
independent of the location of consumption, creating
more heterogeneity in production exposure. Moreover, differences in technological adoption also induce
significant heterogeneity in sectoral exposures to metals
and oil across countries. For instance, whereas the
total metal exposure of the motor vehicle sector in the
average country is 16 percent, the 10th percentile is
5 percent, and the 90th percentile is 34 percent.
Second, metals are more relevant than oil in production in 7 of the top 25 countries. Nevertheless, once
consumption shares are used to aggregate, only three
countries display larger exposure to metals than to oil.
Indeed, the median CPI exposure is three times larger
for oil than for metals.
Third, there are significant cross-country differences.
Although the median country has a metals exposure of
0.03, a country in the 90th percentile has an exposure
that is five times larger than that of a country in the
10th percentile of the distribution. For instance, a
10 percent supply-driven increase in metals prices would
generate a 0.36 percentage point increase in China’s
CPI, compared with a 0.1 percentage point increase for
the United States, according to the network model.

The Impact of Metal Supply Shocks
on Inflation
To study the inflationary consequences of metal and
oil supply shocks empirically, this Special Feature follows
Silva (2023) and uses a small open economy production
network model (see Online Annex 1.1).5 To test the
implications of the model, local projections instrumental
variables (LP-IV) methods are employed. These estimate
the effects of copper and oil price shocks for a balanced
panel of 39 countries from 1996 to 2019.6
Panel 1 of Figure 1.SF.5 shows the cumulative
12-month effects of copper and oil supply shocks on
headline and core inflation. A 10 percent increase in
copper prices raises both headline and core inflation by

Primary metals play a major role as intermediate
inputs for investment goods in production networks.
Given how they enter the production network, metal
supply shocks can have significant, persistent effects
on core and headline inflation. In contrast, oil supply
shocks affect mostly headline inflation.
Does this make the work of central banks easier or
more difficult? Central banks have typically “looked
through” oil price shocks, provided these shocks were
not excessively large. As the energy system moves away
from fossil fuels, however, such an approach may not
work well when economies face major fluctuations in
metals prices.9 Monetary authorities may eventually
need to react to metal supply shocks, because these
shocks have a more persistent effect on core inflation.
In conclusion, central banks must be prepared for a
potentially more metals-intensive global economy in
which metals price shocks could become increasingly
more relevant. Their impact on inflation may initially
appear subtle but could prove to be quite persistent.

oil price shocks show a substantial effect on headline

There are, however, significant differences in the
response of inflation as a function of countries’ network
exposure to metals and oil. The 12-month cumulative
effect of a 10 percent increase in prices on headline
(core) inflation is 0.5 (0.3) percentage point for copper

with low network exposure to metals and oil, the effect
of a 10 percent increase in prices on headline (core)
inflation is 0.1 (0.2) percentage point for copper and
0.5 percentage point (0.1) percentage point for oil.

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

To highlight the delayed and persistent effects on
headline and core inflation, panel 2 of Figure 1.SF.5
shows the cumulative 48-month effects of metal and oil
supply shocks. A 10 percent increase in copper prices
leads to a cumulative 0.5 percentage point increase over
48 months in core inflation for the group of countries
with high network exposure to metals. In contrast, a 10
percent increase in oil prices does not cause any significant increase in core inflation over the long term.7
Overall, empirical results underscore the delayed and
persistent effects of metals prices on inflation through
production networks’ long-lasting effects on marginal
costs through the cost of capital.8

7The persistence of the copper and oil price shocks is roughly
similar. However, copper price shocks have a stronger 48-month
effect on copper prices than oil supply shocks have on oil prices.
See Online Annex 1.1 for more details. Country heterogeneity is not
significant for oil.
8The more persistent effect of metals price shocks is consistent
with the version of the model with a capital stock (see Online
Annex 1.1). Also, since copper represents 30 percent of the IMF’s
trade-weighted base metals index, these estimates are a lower bound
in the case of a supply shock that increases base metals prices by
10 percent, as this effect is expected to be three times greater.
9Supply shocks to metals markets are more dispersed than those
for oil markets, as they typically do not hit each of the metals markets at the same time. This has so far made the magnitude of supply
shocks for the aggregate primary metals sector smaller than that for
those in the petroleum sector.

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE
RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

The recent global inflationary experience was characterized by a complex set of events. During COVID-19
lockdowns, demand shifted toward goods and then pivoted
toward services as economies reopened. These demand
shifts occurred in the context of supply disruptions and
unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. Subsequently, the war in Ukraine led to spikes in commodity
prices. Evidence suggests that the pass-through of sectoral
price pressures to core inflation and the steepening of the
inflation-slack relationship—that is, the Phillips curve—
are essential to understanding the global surge in inflation. This evidence is consistent with key sectors hitting
their supply bottlenecks as demand rotated across sectors
and was boosted over time by a drawdown of savings.
This chapter offers a new lesson and confirms an old one
for monetary policy. In extreme cases when sectoral supply
bottlenecks are widespread across an economy and interact
with strong demand, inflation can surge, but tighter policy can bring it down quickly with limited output costs.
Outside of such cases, when supply bottlenecks are confined to specific sectors, conventional policy rules, such as
those that target measures of core inflation, perform well.

Introduction
The past three years have witnessed an extraordinary
set of inflationary events. Initially, the COVID-19
pandemic triggered widespread economic shutdowns,
causing many businesses to cut back on production. As
the recovery began with pandemic restrictions still in
place, consumer demand for goods surged. However,
producers struggled to ramp up supply quickly enough
amid ongoing supply-chain disruptions, leading to
price pressures in the goods sector. When economies
reopened, price pressures shifted as pent-up demand
for services was released. While instrumental in containing the economic fallout from the pandemic, the

unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus1 deployed
by advanced economies and some emerging markets
initially increased savings. Over time, however, a
drawdown of those savings boosted demand, widening supply-demand imbalances and spurring inflation
as capacity remained constrained. The situation was
exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, which led to a
global food and energy crisis. By mid-2022, global
inflation had tripled relative to its prepandemic level
(Figure 2.1, panel 1).
These inflationary pressures tested monetary policy
frameworks and resulted in a global tightening cycle, or
“Great Tightening.” The sectoral nature of the shocks,
the accompanying relative price shifts, and the uncertainty about their ultimate inflationary effects, as well
as the desire to prevent scarring from the pandemic,
made it a challenge for central banks to calibrate the
timing and pace of monetary responses. Central banks
had to rely on tools and frameworks that did not fully
account for the features of the new economic landscape. The simultaneous use of multiple policy levers
by many countries, including balance sheet policies,
price-suppressing measures, and fiscal policy, required
assessment of their joint effects in real time. Despite the
global nature of the tightening cycle, central banks did
not start their rate hikes at the same time, with some
(for example, Brazil and Chile) moving earlier than
others, depending on country-specific circumstances and
the timing and asymmetric effects of shocks.
Taking stock of the experience since late 2020,
this chapter aims to disentangle the contribution of
shocks and policy responses in accounting for the
inflation surge and the subsequent disinflation, with
the goal of drawing lessons for monetary policymakers.
The chapter’s findings can be informative as rising
geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events are
likely to trigger further sectoral shocks, and as central
banks review their monetary policy strategies and
1Fiscal stimulus amounted to an average of about 12 percent of

GDP in advanced economies and to an average of 4 percent of GDP
in emerging markets (Deb and others 2024); quantitative easing
policies amounted to about 20 percent of GDP in several advanced
economies (Erceg and others 2024a).

frameworks. The chapter’s analysis is structured around
the following questions:
• What accounts for the recent inflation dynamics
in advanced economies and in emerging market
and developing economies? What role did sectoral
shocks and capacity constraints play, and how did
they interact with monetary and fiscal policy?
• Was the monetary policy response or its transmission unusual relative to the past?
• What lessons can be drawn for monetary policy?
Did the global nature of tightening make a
difference?

42

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

The chapter tackles these questions in three parts.
It first lays out stylized facts, both using raw data and
through the lens of empirical Phillips curves. The second part documents the monetary policy response and
transmission across countries and time. Third, findings
from the empirical section motivate the development
of a new multisector network model. The model is
used to construct counterfactual scenarios to assess the
importance of sectoral capacity constraints, the global
nature of monetary tightening, and other fundamental
factors in driving both the recent inflation surge and
the ensuing disinflation. This part also compares the
performance of alternative simple policy rules under
different scenarios.
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• Price surges in specific sectors and their broadening over
time were a defining feature of the recent inflation episode. Price pressures emerged sooner and were more
pronounced in the goods sector and in sectors with
higher energy dependence and flexible prices. The
spillovers from higher prices in the energy and other
sectors to core inflation played an important role.
Overall, there is little evidence in most economies—
with the possible exception of the US—to suggest
that inflation was driven by labor market strength,
at least during peak inflation.
• Price Phillips curves steepened, but wage Phillips curves
did not. The relationship between economic slack
and inflation in the data—that is, price Phillips
curves—shifted upward and steepened. In other
words, inflation accelerated faster than expected
when unemployment declined, and in the same
vein, disinflation took place with fewer job losses
than expected. This was not the case for wage
Phillips curves, as wages did not spike in the same
way as prices did.
• Interaction of supply bottlenecks with demand pressures can rationalize the steepening of price Phillips
curves. The decline in capacity in sectors that were
in high demand—for example, in durable goods
early in the pandemic and in transportation during
reopening—contributed significantly to inflationary
pressures.
• Tightening on a global scale can be more effective than
that by individual countries, as it can lower the price
of tradable goods, especially commodities.
• The prevalence of supply bottlenecks and their interaction with demand are key for policy responses. A diagnosis of the drivers of inflation, though challenging
in real time, remains vital.

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

◦ When the Phillips curve is steep for an economy
overall, the benefits of monetary tightening are
amplified. In other words, counteracting the
inflationary effects of demand in the presence
of prevalent supply bottlenecks—as experienced
recently—presents a favorable sacrifice ratio.
◦ However, when supply constraints are confined to
the commodity sector, conventional policy rules,
such as those targeting measures of core inflation,
remain appropriate. Reacting strongly to flexible
commodity prices, when supply constraints are
present only in those sectors, brings down inflation fast but risks a recession later. In contrast,
targeting sticky prices results in more gradual
disinflation with a smoother output path.
The chapter focuses mainly on the role of policy
interest rates through conventional demand channels.
As such, it is complementary to other work focusing on
the role of central bank communications in inflation
expectations (see Chapter 3 of the October 2023 World
Economic Outlook), financial market risks, balance sheet
policies (Box 2.1), price-suppressing measures (Box
2.2), liquidity measures, and other policy instruments
beyond policy rates. Although lessons in these areas can
be drawn from recent experience, the stability of longterm inflation expectations and the lack of broad-based
financial distress motivate the chapter’s focus on interest
rates, economic slack, and sectoral activity.

What Happened? Dissecting Inflation
Dynamics
Starting in late 2020, inflation rose simultaneously and unexpectedly across the world to levels not
seen since the 1970s (Figure 2.1, panel 1). Annual
inflation peaked in 2022 at about 8 percent in the
median advanced economy and emerging market
and extended beyond that in the median low-income
country, before receding over the course of 2023. The
inflation surge was largely unexpected. Starting in
2021, World Economic Outlook forecasts, like many
others, underestimated inflation for many countries,
as evidenced by positive forecast errors in panel 2 of
Figure 2.1.2 The positive forecast errors were even
larger in 2022, particularly for advanced economies,
in which the median forecast error reached 2.5 per2Koch and Noureldin (2024) provide an in-depth analysis of
inflation forecast errors.

centage points (1.1 percentage points for emerging
markets and 1.5 percentage points for low-income
countries). The disinflation of 2023–24 also progressed faster than expected, with negative forecast
errors this time, especially for forecasts made in 2023
regarding 2024 inflation.
Even though global inflation reached unprecedented levels in recent history, the feared de-anchoring
of inflation expectations reminiscent of the 1970s
(Carvalho and others 2023) did not materialize,
although short-term expectations and nominal wages
went up (Figure 2.1, panels 3 and 4). Crucially, real
wage growth remained contained in most economies
and wage-price spirals—simultaneous accelerations of
nominal wages and prices—did not occur in line with
most historical experience (Alvarez and others 2024).
A defining feature of this inflationary episode was
the prevalence of large sectoral shifts driven by both
supply and demand. As a result of these shifts, relative
prices changed and the variation in inflation across
sectors spiked (Figure 2.2). Two main forces were at
play. First, demand initially rotated toward goods amid
lockdowns and supply-chain disruptions (Figure 2.3,
panels 1 and 2). This caused goods inflation to take
off, before a rebalancing of demand as the lockdowns
eased. Because of this, inflation peaked earlier and
higher in goods than in services. Second, the war

in Ukraine placed substantial pressure on noncore
components of headline inflation. These drove the
lion’s share of both the increase and the subsequent
decrease in overall inflation (Figure 2.3, panel 3),
with a major role for food price inflation, particularly
in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Central
Asia, whereas energy prices were the primary driver of
inflation dynamics in Europe.
The increases in commodity prices had substantial downstream effects, because commodities are an
input for many other sectors. Using international
input-output tables, the chapter computes the direct
and indirect energy dependence of sectors through
their supply chains. Inflation initially surged in
energy-dependent sectors in 2021, even before the
war in Ukraine began. During 2022, inflation in
energy-dependent sectors peaked; inflation broadened
and started rising in sectors with low energy dependence. Whereas inflation came down markedly in the
energy-dependent sectors, it was just plateauing in
less energy-dependent industries at the end of 2023
(Figure 2.3, panel 4), and these industries then became
the primary drivers of overall inflation.
This is broadly consistent with past patterns in
transmission of energy shocks across sectoral networks: energy shocks spread according to sectoral
price flexibility and energy dependence (Online Annex
Figure 2.2.6), with stronger pass-through in more
energy-dependent sectors and in sectors with more
flexible prices (Minton and Wheaton 2022; Afrouzi,
Bhattarai, and Wu 2024). Even though the energy
price shocks were extraordinarily large this time
around (Online Annex Figure 2.2.2), the pass-through
was not necessarily out of line. Historically, the peak
pass-through from a 1 percentage point increase in
energy prices into consumer price index (CPI) inflation at the country level was about 0.06 percentage
point in advanced economies and 0.17 percentage
point in emerging market and developing economies.3
3These estimated magnitudes are in the ballpark of those in Task

Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the ESCB (2010);
Choi and others (2018); Minton and Wheaton (2022); and Afrouzi,
Bhattarai, and Wu (2024). The larger impact on emerging market
and developing economies partly reflects the greater share of
energy-intensive sectors (for example, mining and manufacturing) in
those countries (see also the October 2023 Asia and Pacific Regional
Economic Outlook). Online Annex Figure 2.2.4 additionally tests for
nonlinearities in pass-through, which are a feature of some structural
models, such as that of Cavallo, Lippi, and Miyahara (2023).
Although there is some evidence for nonlinearities in energy price
pass-through, there is no evidence for a broad-based postpandemic
strengthening of these nonlinearities. All online annexes are available

sample covers 2010–24 data for 26 advanced economies (AEs) and 9 emerging market

2020 onward. The first two quarters of 2020 are excluded. Controls include two lags of

The values were comparable this time around, because
the pass-through from energy prices into CPI inflation
did not strengthen materially across a wide range of
countries (Figure 2.4; Online Annex Figures 2.2.4
and 2.2.5).4 Moreover, countries with lower energy
price inflation, notably Asian emerging market and
developing economies (Online Annex Figure 2.2.2,

that energy prices may have played a prominent role
in inflation dynamics—a theme that is revisited in

this chapter using statistical inflation decompositions
and in Box 2.2, in which the role of price-suppressing
measures in containing (energy) inflation is explored.
Partly because of the role of energy and commodity price shocks, headline inflation was initially led
by more price-flexible goods sectors such as energy,
vehicles, and household equipment and followed by
flexible-price services sectors such as restaurants, hotels,
and recreation. These flexible-price sectors explain
the bulk of the rise and fall in inflation observed in
the United States and the euro area. Sectors with
more rigid prices did not experience substantial price
increases until late 2022 and early 2023. By the end
of 2023, however, inflation was driven primarily by
inflexible-price sectors such as clothing, communications, and health (Figure 2.5, panels 1 and 2). The
chapter’s structural model captures different degrees of

price stickiness across sectors and the pass-through of
inflation from flexible to sticky prices over time.
Before turning to the implications of these patterns
for monetary policy, this section further dissects these
inflation dynamics through the lens of aggregate and
sectoral Phillips curves.

Shifting and Steepening of the Phillips Curve
Monetary policymakers pay particular attention to
the relationship between economic slack and inflation,
or the Phillips curve, because this relationship provides a measure of forgone employment and output
as a cost of lowering inflation. Prior to the pandemic,
the relationship was relatively flat, suggesting a weak
trade-off between output and inflation (Blanchard
2016; Del Negro and others 2020; Hazell and others
2022; Rubbo 2023).5 In other words, before 2020,
even when the economy was close to full employment,
inflationary pressures were weak. However, during the
pandemic, the empirical Phillips curve notably steepened and shifted upward (Figure 2.6; Ari and others
2023; Benigno and Eggertsson 2023; Gudmundsson,
Jackson, and Portillo 2024; Inoue, Rossi, and Wang
2024). These patterns were particularly pronounced in
advanced economies, and when comparisons are made
across sectors, the shifting and steepening of empirical
Phillips curves were somewhat more pronounced for
goods than for services inflation (Figure 2.6, panels 2
and 3; Online Annex Figure 2.2.7). The steeper slope
of the empirical Phillips curve implies that for a given
decrease in economic slack, a larger increase in inflation
was observed; conversely, a given increase in economic
slack was associated with a larger decline in inflation.
This pattern is consistent with the finding in the previous section that forecasts, presumably based on flatter
prepandemic Phillips curves, underestimated inflation
when it was surging and overestimated it when it was
declining.
To test these relationships at the country level, the
chapter estimates empirical Phillips curve relationships country by country and compares coefficients
before and after the pandemic. The results confirm
that the patterns were nearly universal across advanced
economies and most emerging markets (Figure 2.6,
panels 2 and 3). This holds true as well in a richer
5As discussed in McLeay and Tenreyro (2020), the flat prepandemic Phillips curve may also partly be the result of monetary policy
that accommodated cost-push shocks and successfully stabilized
economies in the wake of demand shocks.

including lagged inflation (to control in turn for potential mean reversion), inflation expectations, and energy
and import prices (Online Annex Figure 2.2.7, panels 1
and 2).6
6Hooper, Mishkin, and Sufi (2020); McLeay and Tenreyro (2020);
and Hazell and others (2022) argue for identifying Phillips curves
from regional data to mitigate concerns about cost-push shocks biasing
Phillips curves estimates from aggregate data. A regional estimation
within the euro area with time fixed effects (Online Annex Figure
2.2.7, panels 5 and 6) confirms results presented earlier in the chapter.

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

However, the patterns were less pronounced for the
empirical wage Phillips curve, which did not steepen
much in either advanced economies or emerging
markets, but shifted upward as short-term inflation
expectations increased (green boxplots in Figure 2.6,
panel 3). Because wages were less responsive, recent
inflation dynamics likely did not reflect, at least not
solely, excessive tightness in the labor market. The
chapter’s structural model rationalizes the steepening
of the Phillips curve with shocks and constraints that
originate outside of the labor market.

Pass-Through of Commodity Price Shocks
If a richer estimated Phillips curve is employed
(Online Annex Figure 2.2.7), inflation in different
countries can be decomposed through use of a methodology similar to that of Ball, Leigh, and Mishra
(2022) and Dao and others (2024). Such a statistical
decomposition does not break down the contribution
of structural shocks to inflation but instead provides
a correlational analysis of key factors contributing to
inflation dynamics.7
Across the board, with the possible exception of the
United States during the later period, since mid-2022,
tight labor markets (a proxy for the amount of slack
in the economy) play a moderate role in explaining
inflation dynamics (Figure 2.7). This result is consistent with findings noted earlier in the chapter of a
muted real wage response and limited changes to the
wage Phillips curve. Instead, energy shocks and other
shocks to headline inflation played an outsized role.
These shocks were subsequently passed on to broader
inflation, with import prices accounting for a sizable
part of the pass-through in emerging markets. Finally,
long-term inflation expectations remained anchored
across countries and did not directly contribute to
inflation dynamics.
More specifically, US inflation (Figure 2.7,
panel 1) was initially driven by energy price shocks
and other sector-specific shocks as shortages and the
pandemic disrupted supply chains. These headline
shocks subsequently passed through into broader

Note: US inflation drivers are estimated on monthly data (following Dao and others
2024) and then converted to quarterly; for other countries, estimation is conducted on
quarterly data. “Slack” is measured using the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio for AEs
and using the unemployment gap (estimated using a univariate Hodrick-Prescott filter)
for EMs. Country-level contributions for AEs and EMs are aggregated across country
groups using purchasing-power-parity GDP weights. Fitted values for inflation gap are
converted into 12-month rates. AEs = advanced economies; EMs = emerging markets.

7The impact of economic slack also captures the aggregate
demand effects of fiscal stimulus or monetary policy. The impact
through short-term inflation expectations is captured under passthrough, and the impact of food prices is captured under other
headline shocks. The specification employed in the chapter allows
labor market tightness to affect core inflation directly, rather than
only indirectly through wage inflation, consistent with the evidence
of Dao and others (2024).

inflation in 2021 and early 2022. Since mid-2022,
however, the main driver of US inflation has been
a tight labor market.8 By the first quarter of 2024,
labor market tightness was still contributing 2.5 percentage points to US CPI inflation, which was partly
offset by a modest deflation in energy costs.
In contrast, the contribution of labor market slack
to inflation in other advanced economies and emerging markets was small. Inflation in other advanced
economies, particularly those in Europe (Figure 2.7,
panel 2), was initially driven by large energy price
shocks that passed through into broad inflation, with
the pass-through of energy price shocks alone contributing more than 2.5 percentage points to CPI inflation
at its peak. For emerging markets (Figure 2.7, panel 3),
import price pass-through was a significant driver
of inflation pass-through, which would include any
exchange rate effects, because import prices in local
currency were used.9
Understanding the recent inflation dynamics requires
understanding how sectoral shocks, including those
in the energy and commodity sectors, led to broadbased inflationary pressures. Going beyond traditional
models with one sector, the multisector structural model
employed here sheds further light on the pass-through
of sectoral shocks across the production network.

The Monetary Policy Reaction
Faced with the pandemic, central banks worldwide
initially adopted expansionary monetary policies aimed
at stimulating economies and maintaining financial
stability (Figure 2.8, panel 1). As broader inflationary pressures emerged, central banks transitioned to
tightening policy. Although the tightening was broadly
synchronized, its exact timing and pace varied across
countries, depending on the impact of the shocks on
8As argued by Ball, Leigh, and Mishra (2022); Barnichon and
Shapiro (2024); and Bernanke and Blanchard (2024), labor market
tightness in the United States is measured using the vacancy-tounemployment ratio. Elsewhere, labor market tightness plays a much
smaller role, regardless of the measure of tightness (vacancy-tounemployment ratio or unemployment gap). Again, except in
the case of the United States, using the output gap as the measure of economic slack results in similar findings (Online Annex
Figure 2.2.7, panels 3 and 4), as does using country-by-country
estimates for countries for which monthly data are available.
9Online Annex Figure 2.2.8 provides a detailed breakdown,
highlighting, among other features, the importance of energy and
headline shocks in eastern European emerging market and developing economies. Residuals across emerging markets overall could be
explained partly by the cross-border transmission of global liquidity
(Choi and others 2017).

individual economies, the timing of lockdowns and
reopening, and initial conditions and institutional
features. For example, commodity price increases after
the start of the war in Ukraine led to terms-of-trade
improvements for exporters, but to terms-of-trade
deteriorations for importers. Central banks with a
history of low and stable inflation had built policy
credibility and could afford to “look through” seemingly transitory supply shocks for longer. In contrast,
the presence of wage and price indexation mechanisms

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

limited room to maneuver in many countries. Finally,
variation in other policy settings, such as the size of
fiscal stimulus or price-suppressing measures, motivated different monetary responses. These differences
resulted in some emerging market and developing
economies, such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, starting
their rate hikes earlier than others. Conversely, Asia
exhibited a more tempered response, and the United
States adjusted its policies relatively later (Figure 2.8,
panel 2).

Policy Responses Compared with
Those in the 1970s
The energy price shocks of the 1970s, which also
had global repercussions, offer a natural, though
imperfect, benchmark for comparing policy responses
during the recent inflation surge. The benchmarking
is imperfect because of the transformative changes in
monetary policy frameworks and policy credibility
since the 1970s and the fact that the recent experience
coincided with a pandemic.
Such comparisons are facilitated by identifying inflationary episodes in a global sample. Following Ari and
others (2023), this section defines an inflation episode
as a period with an increase in inflation of more than
2 percentage points in a year. Such episodes are then
grouped as “resolved” or “unresolved,” in which an episode is considered resolved if inflation declines in the
neighborhood of 1 percentage point of its pre-episode
level within a five-year window. Comparison of the
post-2020 and 1970s episodes yields the following
observations (Figure 2.9):
• Post-2020 inflation episodes have been more pronounced and persistent compared with the resolved
episodes of the 1970s, with inflationary pressures
building sharply during the episodes (shaded gray
areas in the figure) and continuing to rise in the
subsequent year.
• Nominal interest rate hikes during resolved episodes of the 1970s were larger, as real rates swiftly
transitioned to contractionary territory (Figure 2.9,
panel 2). In contrast, post-2020 episodes involved
a milder nominal rate adjustment and a more
prolonged expansionary policy stance, indicated by
sustained negative real interest rates.
• During unresolved episodes, the median policy stance
remained consistently expansionary, characterized by
more prolonged and more negative real interest rates
than observed after 2020.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Overall, the recent episode lies between the resolved
and unresolved episodes of the 1970s in terms of
inflation dynamics and the speed of the policy
response. This conclusion for the policy response is
corroborated when comparing the deviations from
policy rates that would be implied by a simple policy
rule targeting inflation and the output gap (Online
Annex Figure 2.2.9). Although inflation expectations
data for the 1970s are limited, proxying the degree of
inflation expectations anchoring using past inflation
volatility reveals that inflation expectations were more
strongly anchored this time around (Online Annex
Figure 2.2.10).

Transmission of Monetary Policy Tightening:
Continuities and Changes
As has been documented in this chapter, monetary
policy tightening kick-started after the initial extraordinary pandemic effects subsided, with most of the
tightening occurring later in the episode.
But did the extraordinary shocks result in monetary transmission that was very different from
historical experience? The answer is not obvious because some forces at play point to weaker
transmission, whereas others point to a stronger
transmission. For example, the policy transmission
through housing markets may have weakened in
some countries, given that the growing popularity of
fixed rate mortgages may have reduced the sensitivity of households’ payments to rising interest rates
(see Chapter 2 of the April 2024 World Economic
Outlook). Similarly, excess household savings have
buffered household finances in many countries and
may have resulted in resilience in consumption
even as policy tightened. The globally synchronized
nature of the tightening may have weakened the
exchange rate channel of monetary policy, whereas it
may have strengthened other channels, for example,
through the world price of commodities (Bernanke,
Gertler, and Watson 1997; Blanchard and Galí
2007b; Auclert and others 2023). Moreover, a
steeper Phillips curve, as documented in the previous section, may imply that tightening could have
a small effect on output but a strong disinflationary
impact. Given these different forces, this section
measures overall transmission.
The preliminary evidence suggests some variation but not a broad-based and significant change in

transmission over time. The comparison focuses on the
transmission of a standardized monetary policy tightening shock, as estimated by a vector autoregression
model with time-varying coefficients, across selected
countries during tightening cycles since the 1990s.10
Estimates from the model suggest that the peak
effects of consumer prices vary somewhat in response
to the tightening shock (Figure 2.10; Online Annex
Figure 2.3.2). However, the analysis does not detect a
systematic and statistically significant difference in the
magnitude of the responses when the post-2022 price
responses are compared with the average transmission
observed during the tightening cycles in the 1990s
through 2019. This conclusion also holds when the
full path of impulse responses over time, as opposed
to only the peak effects, are compared (Online Annex
Figure 2.3.1).
Several caveats are in order. The methodology
employed in this section is designed to detect, using
data available, significant changes in the overall transmission of policy tightening so far in countries’ tightening cycles. It therefore does not rule out moderate

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

changes, given uncertainty surrounding the estimates,
or the possibility that its conclusions will change once
more data become available.

Lessons for Monetary Policy:
A Model-Based Analysis
Guided by the chapter’s findings so far, this section
develops a new global model with input-output linkages, the Global Dynamic Network Model, to derive
further policy insights. Crucially, the model includes
these features:
• Rich input-output linkages across sectors and countries.
To replicate the transmission of price pressures in
individual sectors to core inflation, as in the empirical section, the model considers multiple sectors
that are connected through input-output linkages.
Relative demand for each sector can change both as
a response to prices rising more in some sectors and
if households’ tastes change, as happened, for example, when demand for goods relative to services rose
during the pandemic lockdowns. Because it features
two countries with trade linkages, the model can
assess the role of synchronized global tightening.
• Occasionally binding supply constraints. The model
features sectoral constraints, in the form of limits on
the maximum employment level of firms, that bind
occasionally. These constraints mimic supply bottlenecks, and as will be shown, they are a key ingredient
for rationalizing the recent steepening of the aggregate
Phillips curve documented in the empirical section
and observed in many countries (Gudmundsson,
Jackson, and Portillo 2024; Comin, Johnson, and
Jones 2023). In normal times, employment is rarely
near these limits. However, in extreme cases such as
lockdowns, in which the maximum employment in
a sector may fall, or demand may surge in certain
sectors (durable goods is an example), then these constraints can limit production. Such dynamics would
result in higher prices in sectors with binding supply
constraints and would also trickle down to the rest
of the economy, especially if constrained sectors are
major providers of inputs to other sectors and those
inputs are not easily substitutable.
• Aggregate and sectoral shocks. Given the potential role
of monetary and fiscal stimulus during an episode,
the model allows for monetary policy shocks as well
as shocks to aggregate demand, in addition to a rich
set of sectoral demand and supply shifts.

Note: The blue line shows combination of the impact effect of real GDP (x-axis) and

including a relative demand shock. The gray bars (right scale) show the share of the
economy constrained. The red line shows the same combination without any supply
bottlenecks imposed. The Phillips curve shape will depend on choice of constraints.

Widespread Bottlenecks and Rationalization of
Steep Phillips Curves
To illustrate how the model can account for
the steepening of Phillips curves, both panels in
Figure 2.11 present the relationship between peak
effects of inflation and output in a scenario in which
monetary policy starts out contractionary (on the
left) and gradually becomes more expansionary (on
the right). In both panels, the supply constraints are
set such that they become binding in more sectors as
demand strengthens.
• Steepening. When monetary policy is contractionary and demand is low, sectors operate below their
labor constraints, and increases in demand lead
to both higher employment and higher inflation.
However, as policy becomes more expansionary,
more sectors hit their supply constraints, as shown

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

51

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

by the gray bars in panel 1 of Figure 2.11 (see also
Online Annex Figure 2.4.1). In turn, firms in these
sectors cannot increase employment and output,
and instead, prices must rise to equalize supply and
demand. When such constraints are widespread,
adding up across sectors for the entire macroeconomy reveals a nonlinear relationship between
inflation and output; that is, a nonlinear aggregate
Phillips curve (blue line). In the absence of supply
bottlenecks, the analysis would have resulted in a
linear aggregate Phillips curve (red line), underscoring the importance of the bottlenecks as a key
mechanism in the model to account for the findings
of the empirical section.11
• Shifting. Panel 2 of Figure 2.11 illustrates how the
Phillips curve can shift when relative demand shocks
are also added. In that case, high-demand sectors
hit their supply constraints and face upward price
pressures. At the same time, other sectors produce
less because of weak demand. The combination of
higher prices (in constrained sectors) and weak output (in unconstrained sectors) leads to an upward
shift in the aggregate Phillips curve.
Because the model allows for both a steepening and
a shift of the Phillips curve, the relative strength of the
two alternatives is then determined by the data.

Impact of Commodity Supply and Demand

Role of Constraints and Commodity-Specific
Shocks
To unpack the role of supply constraints and
commodity-sector-specific shocks through the lens of
the model, this section takes the model to the data and
presents counterfactual scenarios.
With the United States and the rest of the world
set as the two countries or regions in the model,
sectoral and aggregate shocks are quantified to match
the data. Because the matched data include inflation
and output, the model matches the sectoral dispersion
shown in panels 1 and 2 of Figure 2.12 (similar to the
empirical section). In the same figure, panel 4 shows
that supply constraints were an important persistent
drag on real GDP during this period. In addition,
11Other mechanisms can also result in a steepening of the Phillips
curve, such as asymmetries in wage setting, quasi-kinked demand for
goods or informational frictions, and state-dependent pricing (Ilut,
Valchev, and Vincent 2020; Harding, Lindé, and Trabandt 2022,
2023; Benigno and Eggertsson 2023; Dupraz 2024; Karadi and

that the sum of all bars will equal the black line in each period. In panels 5 and 6 the

remain as in the observed data, but monetary policy responds to changes in inflation,
and that identified supply constraints in noncommodity sectors remain. agr. =

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

they led to significant upward price pressures early in
the pandemic, contributing 2–3 percentage points to
US inflation during 2020–22 and playing a role in the
subsequent disinflation, with a negative net contribution after 2023 (Figure 2.12, panel 3).12 The inflation impacts appear to be less significant than GDP
effects, largely because the supply bottlenecks—even
if they may last for an extended period—raise prices
persistently, leading to one-off rather than persistent
increases in inflation.13
Because the empirical decompositions attribute an
important role to “headline shocks,” which include
shocks to food and energy prices, a scenario with a
similar spirit can be considered. Specifically, panels 5
and 6 in Figure 2.12 turn off the shocks specific to the
agriculture and raw energy sectors. The exercise reveals
that inflation would have been lower when these shocks
are turned off, especially around the beginning of the
war in Ukraine, when supply constraints in these sectors
were tightest. Turning off shocks specific to commodity
sectors makes a smaller difference for GDP.
Although the important role of the agriculture
and raw energy sectors in regard to inflation broadly
aligns with the empirical analysis (if findings for the
US are used to compare the two, given the model’s
calibration), the two exercises are not identical. One
important difference arises because shocks specific to
agriculture and raw energy, which are turned off in
this exercise, are not the only drivers of prices in their
corresponding sectors. That’s why turning off shocks
to these sectors does not mean that their prices remain
constant throughout the exercise. In fact, the analysis suggests that aggregate demand shocks (especially
because agriculture and energy have relatively flexible
prices) and constraints in other sectors (which raise
input prices) play a role, too. In contrast, empirical
decompositions take these sectoral prices as exogenous
and measure their contributions to core inflation relative to a case in which they are unchanged, remaining
agnostic about their drivers.
12The blue and red bars in panels 3 and 4 include supply constraints and their interactions with other shocks. “Other shocks,”
shown by the gray bars, include everything else. Because all shocks
interact with supply constraints in complex ways, producing more
detailed bars implying mutually exclusive contributions of shocks
would be misleading.
13Supply bottlenecks can arise from tightening supply constraints
for a given level of demand and their interaction with demand. The
reported contributions measure the total impact of supply constraints, capturing the effects of supply constraints both in isolation
and in combination with demand.

Policy Experiments
To draw policy lessons, this section undertakes
two sets of analyses. The first comprises counterfactual scenarios with policies set differently from what
central banks actually did. Because the data are first
matched to the recent period featuring the effects of
the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the resulting
policy lessons are more relevant for such tail event
situations. The second set of analyses considers a hypothetical run-of-the-mill scenario. It features a supply
constraint binding only for food and energy and a
positive aggregate demand shock. For example, it could
capture a situation in which a drought or a geopolitical
shock constrains supply in agriculture and energy and
is accompanied by fiscal support to contain its effects.
In comparison with the experience since the pandemic,
the share of sectors subject to supply bottlenecks would
be much smaller in this scenario.
Counterfactual Scenarios
The counterfactual scenarios first ask, Would different
policy choices by central banks have made a difference
during the inflation surge? And how would they have
interacted with bottlenecks? To answer these questions,
Figure 2.13 presents cases in which policy tightens three
quarters earlier than observed, combined with different
assumptions about the presence of bottlenecks.
• Tightening earlier, shown by the solid red lines,
lowers peak inflation by about 2 percentage points
relative to the data (Figure 2.13, panel 1) but results
in a 0.8 percentage point reduction in real GDP
(Figure 2.13, panel 2) for 2022.
• Comparing two versions of the “earlier tightening”
counterfactual further reveals the role of supply
bottlenecks. When capacity constraints are imposed
at levels estimated from fitting the model to the data
(solid red lines), tighter policy has greater potency
in lowering inflation, with low output cost relative
to the case in which the constraints are assumed
away (dashed red lines). This is because the constraints steepen the Phillips curve, as shown earlier,
making expansionary policies more inflationary but
also making it less costly to bring down inflation
through monetary tightening. This comparison
highlights how supply bottlenecks can steepen the
Phillips curve and affect the cost of disinflation.
Would different policy choices by other central
banks have made a difference? In the counterfactual
scenario, the rest of the world tightens monetary

observed inflation and the counterfactual scenario is
displayed by the bars in Figure 2.14 for each sector.15

flexible prices—experience stronger inflation than the

Hypothetical Scenario
The analysis next turns to a hypothetical scenario
with positive aggregate demand shocks combined with
negative capacity constraint shocks in the agriculture,
mining, and energy sectors for both countries or
regions in the model. As explained in this chapter, this
would correspond to a milder set of shocks than those
considered so far.
Figure 2.15 compares four simple monetary policy
rules in this scenario: (1) targeting inflation in sectors
with the stickiest prices;16 (2) “inflation forecast targeting,” which aims to stabilize the four-quarter moving
average of future CPI inflation; and (3) “average
inflation targeting,” in which the central bank targets
the average of the preceding four quarters of inflation,
as well as (4) a sectoral Taylor rule that targets equally
CPI inflation and sectoral inflation in agriculture,
mining, and energy, which are the sectors subject to
supply constraints but also those with the most flexible
prices. The first three rules tend to be widely used
or discussed, and the last one helps assess whether
16These sectors are information technology and telecommunications; finance and insurance; professional, scientific, and technical;
education, health, and government services; and arts, entertainment,
and recreation.

Note: The Taylor rules are identical except for the inflation measure targeted. “Targeting
stickiest prices” targets the five sectors with the steepest Phillips curves. “Inflation
forecast targeting” targets the four-quarter moving average of future CPI inflation.
“Average inflation targeting” represents average inflation targeting in which the central
bank targets the average of the previous four quarters of inflation. “50/50 on CPI and
constrained sectors” targets CPI inflation and sectoral inflation in agriculture, mining,
and energy. “Flexible prices” shows relative prices in a scenario without nominal
rigidities in any sector market. In each case the Taylor parameter is 3, the persistence
parameter is 0.5, and neither GDP nor the output gap is targeted. CPI = consumer price
index.

inflation, which is lower than inflation on impact,
and leads to a surge in inflation and inflation
expectations. Despite higher nominal rates, this rule
delivers lower real rates than the other policy rules.
This leads to higher output initially but requires a
prolonged medium-term reduction in real GDP to
bring inflation to target.17
• The policy rule with the higher weight on food
and energy tightens markedly more on impact,
because food and energy prices are more flexible
and sensitive to the demand shock, and these
sectors themselves are supply constrained. The
imposition of supply constraints, even if binding
persistently, has transitory effects on inflation
(Online Annex Figure 2.4.5).18 When policy
focuses on these sectors, it overreacts to transitory
inflation, delivering a sharp recession. As shocks
dissipate, food and energy prices fall faster than the
overall CPI, because they are more flexible, leading
to a rapid fall in policy rates, and in turn, inflation
and GDP surge. Although this policy rule delivers
relative prices closer to the flexible-price benchmark in the short term, in the longer term, relative
price movements are more persistent, distorting
resource allocation for longer (Online Annex
Figure 2.4.6).
• “Average inflation targeting” features inflation and
GDP responses that are most like those arising
from the rule targeting inflation in the sectors with
the stickiest prices. The main difference is that the
delayed response of average inflation targeting to
inflation delivers a more gradual return of inflation
to target, which leads real GDP to remain below the
steady state in the medium term for longer.

Summary and Policy Implications
front-loading the policy adjustments in response to
price increases in constrained sectors is appropriate.
Because monetary policy can only alleviate the effect of
nominal frictions on an economy’s response to shocks,
a benchmark “efficient” economy output for the case
in which prices and wages are assumed to be perfectly
flexible is also shown, in panel 3 of the figure.
Comparing the alternative policy rules yields the
following insights (Figure 2.15):
• Targeting inflation in the stickiest-price sectors
delivers relatively fast disinflation. By contrast, the
inflation forecast targeting rule ends up “running
the economy hot” by responding to medium-term

A defining characteristic of the recent inflationary episode was the prominence of sectoral shifts amid policy
stimulus and capacity constraints, partly arising from
17These downsides from forecast-based policy rules relative to
targeting realization-based inflation are similar to the results from
Erceg, Lindé, and Trabandt (2024). Despite the broad similarities in
their conclusions, the frameworks in the two studies are different in
terms of specific scenarios considered and the underlying mechanisms. For example, Erceg, Lindé, and Trabandt (2024) allow price
and wage setters to index more intensively after prolonged periods of
high inflation, amplifying the costs of delayed policy tightening.
18Supply constraints require higher prices to realign demand in a
sector to be consistent with the constrained production available.
Once prices have risen, no further price increases are required to keep
sectoral demand low. This leads to a transitory effect on inflation.

supply-chain disruptions. Statistical decompositions
attribute an important role to price pressures arising
from individual sectors and their spillovers to core inflation. Evidence also suggests that the relationship between
inflation and economic slack shifted and steepened.
In line with the empirical findings, a newly developed
structural model can account for the transmission of
sector-specific price pressures to the rest of an economy,
as well as the shifting and steepening of Phillips curves,
with a mechanism running through binding supply
constraints combined with demand shocks.
Even though the episode was unique, central banks
can still draw lessons from the experience, especially as
they review their monetary policy frameworks. In this
vein, the chapter offers the following insights.
Sectoral supply constraints tend to have large but
short-lived effects on inflation as they start to bind.
Steeper Phillips curves stem from the interaction of
these constraints with demand shocks. Hence, policymakers should aim to differentiate between the
immediate and transitory effects of sectoral constraints
and their more persistent impact when combined with
demand pressures.
The chapter draws an important distinction between
the steepening of aggregate Phillips curves and that
of sectoral Phillips curves. In doing so, it offers a new
policy insight and reaffirms an old one.
• New lesson. When supply bottlenecks are prevalent
and combined with strong demand, the aggregate Phillips curve steepens, as it did in the recent
episode. In such cases, policy tightening is effective
because it can ease demand pressures and bring
down inflation quickly with limited output costs; in
other words, the sacrifice ratio is low. Monitoring
whether key sectors bump against their supply bottlenecks in an overheated economy is crucial.
• Old lesson. When supply bottlenecks are confined to specific sectors, such as commodities,
standard rules, such as those focusing on inflation in sectors with the stickiest prices, remain
appropriate (Blanchard and Galí 2007a; Natal
2012). Although sectoral Phillips curves steepen
in constrained sectors, their effects may not spread
widely enough to cause a steepening of the aggregate Phillips curve. In that case, monetary tightening can achieve a sharp decline in commodities’
flexible prices, but at the expense of lower output,
and over time, inflation will undershoot as flexible
commodity prices decline and other prices also
react to tighter policy.

56

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

• Putting them together. Central banks should consider
including well-defined escape clauses in their policy
frameworks to tackle inflationary pressures when
aggregate Phillips curves steepen. Forward guidance
should internalize those escape clauses and allow for
front-loading of tightening in such situations.
This distinction aligns with earlier IMF work that
suggests refining the traditional prescription to “look
through” temporary supply shocks. In this context,
Gopinath (2022, 2024) underscores that second-round
effects can be significant if supply shocks are large and
far reaching, particularly when the economy is already
overheated with high inflation. The chapter’s differentiation between widespread bottlenecks and those
confined to specific sectors mirrors the earlier work’s
focus on the size and scope of shocks. In addition, the
chapter’s emphasis on the interaction of these bottlenecks with demand pressures relates to the earlier
work’s observation about the importance of recognizing an already overheated economy.
While “running the economy hot” may have
benefits—for example, facilitating relative price adjustment when shocks are permanent and the economy
needs to adjust accordingly (Guerrieri and others 2021;
Guerrieri and others 2023), those benefits need to be
weighed against the risk of a potential de-anchoring
of inflation expectations and wage-price spirals. When
balancing these risks, central banks should consider not
only the most likely outcomes but also the distribution
of risks, and they should keep inflation from drifting
too far from target for an extended period, especially
when inflation expectations are less anchored and
policy credibility is weaker (Gopinath 2024).
A better understanding of sectoral dynamics can
help central banks calibrate their policy responses more
effectively. Therefore, investing in improved models and
data collection over time would be a valuable endeavor.
• Developing models that capture sectoral linkages
and heterogeneity—as exemplified by the model in
this chapter—can be a step in the right direction,
which should be considered as central banks plan
to revamp their modeling approaches in the context
of their framework reviews (for example, Bank of
England 2024).
• The collection of more granular sectoral data would
allow sectoral networks to be mapped out and models to be refined. How much and how fast sectoral
price pressures propagate across an economy, for
example, depending on the centrality or criticality

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

of sectors or the degree of price stickiness, could be
quantified through such data.
• High-frequency sectoral indicators of supply constraints and demand pressures can support policymaking in real time. Disruptions in supply chains
can arise both upstream (such as component shortages) and downstream (such as congested ports), and
surveys of producers could help identify them early.
Constraints may also emerge from the labor market:
although many central banks monitor labor market
indicators, analyzing them at the sectoral level could
provide a more detailed understanding of shortages.
In addition, measures of overall supply-demand mismatches (such as back orders) could highlight the
interacted effects of supply and demand shocks.
Open economies can benefit from positive spillovers
of other central banks’ policy tightening through lower
tradable goods prices. Such spillovers can be particularly
important for countries that have high exposure to those
prices—for example, those for food and energy, and
limited policy levers to respond to them—for example,
low-income countries with fixed exchange rate regimes.
Exchange rate depreciations and their pass-through into
inflation can exert upward price pressures in countries
with flexible exchange rate regimes if they are not hiking
interest rates at the same time.19 However, the exchange
19Although such currency movements can facilitate expenditure
switching, financial frictions or weakly anchored inflation expectations can hamper macroeconomic stability.

rate channel would be muted relative to the lower tradable goods prices channel to the extent that the policy
tightening is synchronized.
Credible policy frameworks remain a valuable asset
for central banks. The recent experience is a case
in point: inflation expectations remained anchored
and wage-price spirals did not materialize even as
policymakers navigated difficult policy trade-offs
under immense uncertainty in countries with credible frameworks. Better understanding of inflation
expectations formation across different horizons and
economic agents would help inform policymaking
(Adrian 2023; Alvarez and Dizioli 2023; BrandãoMarques and others 2023; October 2023 World
Economic Outlook).
It is important to emphasize that providing a
precise quantification of the drivers of inflation in
the context of simultaneous shocks during a oncein-a-century pandemic is an inherently difficult task.
Reduced-form empirical analyses provide suggestive
correlations. Using aggregate data or single-sector
models leads to difficulties in the identification of
demand and supply shocks, given input-output
linkages: supply constraints in one sector can cause
lower demand in complementary sectors that produce
their intermediate inputs. The chapter’s multisector
model can capture such interlinkages and emphasizes
supply constraints but also finds that their interaction
with demand shocks must have played an important
role in generating the size and persistence of inflation
observed in the data.

Box 2.1. The Role of Central Bank Balance Sheet Policies
Since the global financial crisis, central banks have
expanded their toolkits by using balance sheet policies
to achieve their objectives at the effective lower bound
(ELB). This box documents that the unwinding of
such policies, specifically quantitative tightening (QT),
has had minimal effects so far, partly because of its
slow and predictable implementation, facilitated by
timely and extensive communication.
Central banks engaged in quantitative easing
(QE) during the pandemic. QE was initially aimed
at mitigating acute pandemic-related financial
distress in spring 2020 and was used by many
emerging markets as well as advanced economies.
However, advanced economy central banks continued to expand their balance sheets even after
the easing of financial distress in order to provide
macroeconomic stimulus, although their policy
rates were constrained by the ELB. Overall, during
2020–22, central bank balance sheets grew by more
than 20 percent of GDP in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, and by about 18 percent
of GDP in the United States (Figure 2.1.1). QE
undertaken in this period is estimated to have had
sizable effects in containing financial distress and
supporting economic activity.
Once inflation surged, central banks began
hiking policy rates and unwinding balance sheet
policies, but QT is not merely QE in reverse.1 First,
central banks generally resort to QE when short-term
policy rates are constrained by the ELB. This is not
the case with QT, which has been used alongside
policy tightening. Second, if QT and rate hikes are
at least partially substitutable, greater QT can be
partly offset by a slower tightening of policy rates—its
effects, therefore, are more muted.2 Third, QT may
take place against a steeper Phillips curve (Erceg and
others 2024a).
Evidence suggests that the effects of QT have so
far been modest. Erceg and others (2024a), drawing
on large-scale asset purchase shocks since the late
1990s, find that a one-standard-deviation QT shock

assets that mature or when it actively sells assets (Du, Forbes,
and Luzzetti 2024).
2The peak impact on inflation from a one-standard-deviation
QT and a similar-sized policy rate shocks is estimated to be
comparable in Erceg and others (2024a).

has had a small, possibly slightly negative, effect on
short-term rates while raising term premiums by
about 12 basis points (Figure 2.1.2). Du, Forbes, and
Luzzetti (2024) find that active QT tended to have a
stronger impact on long-term rates than passive QT
during the recent episode. They also find that the
cumulative impact of QT announcements since 2021
has equaled at most two or three rate hikes in some
countries, thus contributing moderately to a tighter
policy stance.3
However, QT may have larger effects, especially
if conducted more rapidly or on a larger scale.
When reducing its balance sheet size, a central
bank withdraws reserves from the banking system.
3Overall, QT has not been used as an explicit tool to tighten
policy, instead largely working in the background. Moreover,
because experience with QT started only in 2021, the external
validity of these estimates in a macroeconomic environment
very different from the postpandemic recovery remains an open
empirical question (Du, Forbes, and Luzzetti 2024).

CHAPTER 2

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

Box 2.1 (continued)
Although there was excess liquidity during the pandemic, QT may have stronger effects once reserves
become scarce, as witnessed in the United States
in 2019 (Du, Forbes, and Luzzetti 2024). Financial stability risks could also come to the fore: US
commercial banks became more liquidity dependent
through higher issuance of credit lines and increased
financing via uninsured deposits, which raised the
risk of sudden deposit withdrawals, as took place
in March 2023 (Acharya and others 2023). Finally,
advanced economies’ QT strengthens their currencies
(through higher term premiums) more than conventional tightening (through the short-term policy
rate). Hence, there is more pressure on the currencies of emerging market and developing economies
(Figure 2.1.2). This worsens inflation-output tradeoffs in those economies, especially in those with a
fixed exchange rate that must raise rates sharply to
maintain their pegs (Erceg and others 2024a). In
contrast, conventional tightening can achieve similar
macroeconomic outcomes with smaller adverse international spillovers (Erceg and others 2024a).

Box 2.2. The Role of Price-Suppressing Policies
Countries have frequently resorted to tools other
than monetary policy to combat inflation. The
recent inflationary episode was no exception. This box
takes stock of inflation stabilization policies implemented historically and in the postpandemic recovery
and discusses their rationale and limitations.
Energy and consumption subsidies. Subsidies
have historically been used to maintain lower prices,
especially for energy (Black and others 2023). During
the pandemic, most governments subsidized fuel
and electricity and reduced value-added taxes, sales
taxes, and excises on essential goods (Figure 2.2.1).
Subsidies work by absorbing increases in costs, thus
limiting the pass-through to prices. They can tame
inflation driven by temporary cost-push shocks. Dao
and others (2023) find that energy subsidies played
a significant role in stabilizing inflation in the euro
area (Figure 2.2.2) in the recent episode. However,
subsidies have substantial fiscal costs, do not align with
climate-change-related goals, and often fail to target
the vulnerable. They also distort relative prices, leading
to overconsumption of subsidized goods, which fuels
further price rises (Erceg and others 2024b).
Import tax reductions and export restrictions.
Following the pandemic, many countries resorted to
reducing import taxes and imposing export restrictions
to stabilize domestic prices, especially in emerging
markets and low-income countries (Figure 2.2.1).
Import tax cuts lower imported goods prices and
increase domestic supply, whereas export restrictions
can ease domestic inflationary pressures. However, tax
cuts have fiscal costs, and both policies induce adverse
international spillovers by reducing global supply or
increasing global demand, thereby contributing to further price increases (Giordani, Rocha, and Ruta 2016).
Price and wage controls. Historically, price and
wage freezes have been used to curb inflation, in the
United States and Europe in the 1960s and 1970s,
among other instances. They have been used again to
some degree since the pandemic, particularly in emerging markets and low-income countries, primarily on
essential food items (Figure 2.2.1). In specific contexts,
such as when dealing with monopsony (for example,
minimum wage) or monopoly (for example, electricity
pricing) power, these controls can be justified. However, they often lead to adverse outcomes, such as the
emergence of black markets and shortages, and prevent
adjustment in relative prices.

THE GREAT TIGHTENING: INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENT INFLATION EPISODE

Box 2.2 (continued)
Other policies. Government-led negotiations have
been historically employed in many countries to coordinate wage and price setting, during the pandemic as
well as at other times. Although they can be instrumental in managing wage-price spirals and anchoring
expectations, they can also distort relative prices.
Finally, tax on inflation policies, which involve taxes
proportional to a firm’s increase in prices, was widely
discussed and implemented in several advanced and
emerging market economies in the 1970s and 1990s.
Capelle and Liu (2023) show that by providing firms
with incentives to moderate their price increases, tax
on inflation policies can offer substantial stabilization
gains under certain conditions. Although these policies

are useful for addressing inflation coming from costpush shocks and shifts in inflation expectations, their
practical implementation needs to be clarified, and
monetary policy is a better instrument for bringing down inflation arising from excessive aggregate
demand.
To conclude, countries have employed additional
tools to stabilize inflation when monetary policy is
limited, such as during cost-push shocks or under
an exchange rate peg. However, monetary policy
remains the primary tool for managing demand-driven
inflation. The use of alternative tools requires careful
assessment of their effectiveness and trade-offs to minimize potential adverse side effects.

UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF
STRUCTURAL REFORMS

As the world grapples with a prolonged period of economic weakness, demographic shifts, and the imperative
of navigating the green transition and technological
upheavals, the urgency for structural reforms is clearer
than ever. Policymakers are being urged to implement
measures that foster competition, facilitate resource
allocation to emerging sectors, and bolster labor supply
amid aging populations. However, despite the clear need
for action, securing broad social acceptability for policy
changes has often been a significant obstacle, with reform
efforts waning since the global financial crisis amid rising
public resistance. This chapter explores the factors that
shape public attitudes toward structural reforms and
assesses the effectiveness of various strategies for increasing
the social acceptability of policy changes. It finds that
resistance to reforms often transcends economic self-interest
and instead is deeply rooted in behavioral factors that
include perceptions, misinformation, and trust deficits.
Information strategies that raise awareness of the need
for reform and correct misinformation about policies and
misperceptions about how they work can significantly
boost reform support. However, effective strategies require
more than just better communication. They must be
backed by a strong institutional framework that fosters
trust and a two-way dialogue from the early stages of
policy design. Thorough consultation with all stakeholders and the public is essential for identifying mitigating
measures to address the personal and societal concerns
that undercut support for reform. This chapter underscores the potential of informed, inclusive, and trust-based
approaches not only to enhance the quality of policies but
also to significantly increase the likelihood of implementing and sustaining structural reforms that are critical
for boosting productivity, employment, and growth.

Introduction
The global economy has been enduring a prolonged
period of structural weakness, and medium-term
prospects under current policies remain bleak. The
slowdown in global growth is attributed largely to
aging populations, weak investment, and structural
frictions that hinder the reallocation of capital and
labor toward productive firms (see Chapter 3 of the
April 2024 World Economic Outlook [WEO]). This is
especially concerning because demographic pressures
are expected to continue, and structural transformations related to the green transition and technological changes will require significant investment and
resource reallocation.
In this context, policymakers are urged to advance
structural reforms—that is, to update the rules and
policies that shape how an economy operates—to
boost productivity, employment, and growth. Key
priorities include easing entry barriers and fostering
competition in product markets to facilitate the reallocation of resources across sectors, thus helping countries harness the potential benefits of new technologies.
Similarly, reforms to encourage workers to work longer
and to facilitate the integration and improve the skill
matching of foreign-born workers can help counterbalance the labor supply challenges posed by aging
populations.
However, progress on progrowth structural reforms
has historically been slow and uneven across countries
and policy areas (Figure 3.1, panel 1). Although compromises regarding noneconomic goals may play a role
(for instance, prioritizing state control in certain sectors
for national security reasons), securing social acceptability for policy changes is often a major challenge
(Figure 3.1, panel 2). A large body of literature on the
political economy of reforms has emphasized that weak
acceptability and slow progress reflect the uneven distribution of the costs and benefits they entail, across the
economy and over time (for example, Boeri and Navaretti 2006). There is mounting awareness, however, that
resistance to policy changes is often rooted in behavioral aspects that may dwarf the economic self-interest
and equity considerations that have traditionally

underpinned public economics analysis. Among various
behavioral factors influencing reform acceptability, misinformation about the problems tackled by the reform
and misperceptions about how policies work can be
critical deterrents to support (for example, Douenne and
Fabre 2022; Duval and others 2024).
Motivated by the urgent need to move forward
on inclusive growth reform agendas, this chapter
pursues two intertwined objectives: (1) to shed light

66

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

on factors that influence the social acceptability of
structural reforms, and (2) to identify strategies, tools,
and institutions that can enhance the acceptability of
policies, with the ultimate objective of passing reforms
that closely align with desired plans, end up being
implemented, endure over time, and pave the way for
advancing broader agendas. To achieve these objectives,
the chapter seeks to address the following questions:
• Historical overview of reform episodes. How difficult
has it been to implement structural reforms? How
common is the reliance on active communication
and consultation strategies, as well as the use of
complementary or compensatory mitigating measures, to garner consensus, and how effective are
these strategies in practice?
• Drivers of social acceptability. What drives individuals’ attitudes toward reforms? To what extent do
individual characteristics and economic self-interest
determine support? What is the role of perceptions,
information, and other beliefs in driving policy
preferences?
• Policy toolkit for consensus and reform sustainability.
Can information strategies correct misperceptions
about reforms, notably regarding the need for and
the effect of policy changes, and influence attitudes
toward reforms? What other tools, strategies, and
institutions can help policymakers forge consensus,
improve the policy design process, and ensure that
reforms not only are implemented but also endure?
To answer these questions, the chapter focuses on
a set of product and labor market reforms. It begins
by leveraging a novel narrative database to uncover
key facts surrounding reform attempts since the mid1990s to ease product market regulation (PMR) and
increase competition in the electricity sector, provide
incentives for the labor supply of elder workers, and
integrate foreign-born workers into the labor market.
The chapter then collects new evidence from surveys
of individuals to (1) investigate how beliefs and, in
particular, misinformation and misperceptions about
policies affect support for reforms and (2) test whether
providing information—for instance, on how policies work or complementing reforms with measures
that address specific concerns—can increase support.
Finally, the chapter conducts an in-depth review of
11 labor market reform episodes to contextualize lessons from the survey analysis and identify a broader set
of strategies and tools that have helped policymakers
build consensus and sustain reform efforts.

CHAPTER 3

UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS

The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• Passing structural reforms has typically been challenging, but the use of strategies to garner consensus is
associated with higher chances of implementation. A
historical overview of reform episodes shows that the
pace of reform efforts has more than halved since
the global financial crisis of 2008–09. Moreover, a
substantial fraction of reforms that are attempted are
never implemented—nearly 20 percent of policies
aimed at increasing competition in the electricity
sector and almost 50 percent of those providing
incentives for workers to work longer—or get passed
only after being diluted amid resistance. The macroeconomic or political context in which reforms
are attempted can sometimes matter, but it does
not seem determinant. Instead, the use of communication and consultation strategies and mitigating
measures are more reliable predictors of reform
implementation.
• Beliefs and perceptions are key determinants of attitudes
toward structural reforms. Socioeconomic characteristics underlying individuals’ economic self-interest
do influence policy views but, for instance, in the
surveys conducted for this chapter they account for
only 6 percent of individuals’ support for reforms to
increase competition in network sectors and 11 percent for policies to integrate foreign-born workers.
Instead, individuals’ beliefs and perceptions explain
about 80 percent of reform support, and misinformation about policies and misperceptions about
how they work account for about half that support.
• Communication and information strategies, as well as
complementary and compensatory measures, can shift
policy views, especially when forged in a context of
trust. Randomized survey experiments on different
policy areas and in countries at different stages
of development show that providing information
to populations can correct misperceptions about
policies and increase support for reforms. Raising
awareness regarding the need for reform can often
help, and explaining the effect of policies and
how they work appears critical to increasing social
acceptability for reforms. For instance, in the surveys
conducted for this chapter, additional support
for migrant integration policies in the group that
received information about how those policies work
was equivalent to more than 40 percent of the share
of those in the control group who were opposed.
Survey analyses also show that tailored mitigating
measures (complementary policies and compensa-

tory measures) that address not only self-interest,
but also distributional and other societal concerns,
can improve acceptability. However, lack of trust
in the parties involved in the reform and in governments’ ability to adequately implement policies
and mitigating measures can still undermine social
acceptability.
• An expanded toolkit and a strong institutional setting
fostering a two-way dialogue with stakeholders and
the population at large can help policymakers garner
support for implementing and sustaining reforms.
Effective strategies require far more than enhancing
communication. The chapter’s review of country
cases confirms the importance of trust in both the
message and the messenger. Conducting and diffusing policy research by independent, nonpartisan
institutions has often been key to raising awareness
about the need for reform and building consensus.
A strong institutional setting that facilitated consultations with stakeholders, including in the policy
design stage, helped cement trust in policymaking and move forward reforms that also endured.
Instead, attempts to pass reforms that were not
tailored to domestic conditions or that were pushed
along with multiple other major reforms often faced
major implementation challenges or were eventually
reversed.
The chapter’s findings and their implications for
boosting the chances of reform implementation
come with some caveats. First, social acceptability is
not the only factor that matters for implementation
success. For instance, vested interests can influence
decision-making bodies and affect the course of reform
attempts, regardless of whether the population broadly
agrees with the proposed reform. Second, the strategies
underscored in this chapter to cement social acceptability are not a substitute for sound policy design.
The findings underscore that a poor understanding
of policy mechanisms undermines public support,
but a better understanding will not (and should not)
help policymakers pass policies that are ill designed.
Third, public resistance can reflect justifiable concerns
about inappropriately designed reforms. In the same
vein, social acceptability should not be viewed as an
end in itself. Some inconsistent, counterproductive, or
welfare-detrimental reform attempts may encounter
little social resistance, and yet the reforms they are
advocating should not be passed. This underscores
the importance of the chapter’s finding on the role of

knowledge and understanding of policies. A sustained
effort to make independent and trustworthy policy
analysis widely available can help protect societies from
opportunistic populist proposals that hide costs and
undesirable outcomes. Finally, understanding countryand policy-area-specific conditions is critical. However,
with appropriate caveats, the broad principles drawn in
this chapter from different policy fields and countries
at various stages of development can still help policymakers navigate the challenges of implementing and
sustaining reforms.

Social Acceptability of Reforms: A Primer
In essence, structural reforms are policy changes
that modify acquired rights and economic rents with
the aim of improving the allocation of resources in the
economy. As such, they inevitably create winners (the
beneficiaries from efficiency gains) and losers (those
whose rents or acquired rights the reforms affect negatively).1 For instance, reforms to foster competition
can boost output and reduce prices, benefiting workers
and consumers throughout the economy, but the
immediate targets are the rents of the few firms with
market power under existing rules and the workers in
those firms.
The implications for the acceptability of reforms
are, however, less straightforward than simply identifying winners and losers and eventually offsetting
losses. Gains and losses from reforms are unevenly
distributed not only across society, but also over time
(Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003). Costs are often more
evident in the short term and concentrated in a few
well-organized and easily mobilized groups, whereas
gains are diffused and mostly accrue slowly over time.
This dynamic makes the status quo appealing, as its
costs are not immediately apparent and the materialization of payoffs is uncertain (Fernandez and Rodrik
1991; Tompson 2009).
Securing social acceptability for reforms can be
challenging, even when they are designed to balance
increasing overall welfare with fairly compensating
those who are adversely affected. A growing body
of literature has pointed out that public resistance is
not based solely on objective economic self-interest
grounded in individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics,
such as employment status, age, and education level.
1See, for instance, Boeri and Navaretti (2006), Tompson (2009),

and Alesina and others (2023) for discussions on the political economy of structural reforms.

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

Individuals’ views on policies—and consequently, the
social acceptability of reforms—are also significantly
influenced by their beliefs and perceptions, including
those regarding the effects of policies and the willingness or ability of policymakers to implement them as
promised.
For instance, lack of trust in plans to compensate
those affected by policy changes has either derailed tax
and subsidy reforms or required the use of earmarking schemes and other commitment solutions at the
cost of efficiency considerations (Guillaume, Zytek,
and Farzin 2011; Douenne and Fabre 2022; Kanbur
and Levy 2022). Similarly, if potential winners do not
comprehend how a policy change will benefit them,
they may not trust or support it (Stantcheva 2021;
Dechezleprêtre and others 2022; Alfaro, Chen, and
Chor 2023; Dabla-Norris and others 2023; Duval and
others 2024).
With these considerations in mind, the rest of the
chapter investigates how policymakers can enhance the
social acceptability of policies, with the ultimate objective of implementing and sustaining structural reforms.
It focuses on policies that have been previously identified as critical to facilitating the reallocation of resources
across sectors and boosting labor supply amid aging
populations (for example, Ostry, Prati, and Spilimbergo
2009; Chapter 3 of the April 2016 WEO; Chapter 3 of
the October 2019 WEO; Chapter 4 of the April 2020
WEO; Budina and others 2023; Chapter 3 of the April
2024 WEO) but does not explore their macroeconomic
effects—or what constitutes solid policy design—since
this has been covered extensively.

The Challenge of Implementing
Structural Reforms: Key Facts
Despite the well-recognized challenges of passing structural reforms, there is a surprising lack of
cross-country data documenting both successful and
unsuccessful reform attempts. To fill this void, this
chapter constructs a new database that tracks product
and labor market reform episodes during 1996–2023
(Online Annex 3.2).2 The documented reforms aimed
to (1) ease product market regulation to increase
competition in the electricity sector (PMR-electricity
hereafter), (2) provide incentives for labor participation among elder workers (elder LP hereafter), and

WEO.

CHAPTER 3

UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS

(3) increase the integration of foreign-born workers
into labor markets (migrant integration hereafter). The
database is constructed using text analysis of quarterly
country reports from the Economist Intelligence Unit
(EIU) spanning 26 advanced economies, 36 emerging
market economies, and 14 low-income countries. For
each policy area covered, it allows each country-year
observation to be classified into one of three categories: (1) no relevant reform was under discussion, (2) a
reform was under discussion but was not yet implemented, or (3) a reform was implemented.3 Validation
tests confirm that the data set accurately captures
reform information from the EIU reports.
A first notable observation is that the number of
reform episodes, including those when policy changes
were discussed but not implemented, has declined over
time in almost all policy fields and country groups
(Figure 3.2). Splitting the sample in half around the
time of the global financial crisis shows a particularly
sharp drop in PMR-electricity reform episodes—despite
still-large cross-country heterogeneity in regulatory
stances. The pace of elder LP reforms in advanced
economies and emerging market economies has also
slowed in recent years, notwithstanding rising longevity.4 The reduction in reform intensity could reflect
shrinking scope for reforms in some policy areas and
countries, such as PMR in network sectors in advanced
economies. However, it has coincided with a documented increase in social discontent, notably since
the global financial crisis, as captured by episodes of
civil unrest, as well as distrust in public institutions,
dissatisfaction with democracy, and lower voter turnout (OECD 2021). This suggests that less appetite for
policy change among the public may have deterred
policymakers from even attempting needed reforms.
The data also reveal how difficult it has been historically to pass reforms. Only about 50 percent of all
PMR-electricity and elder LP reforms that have been
discussed in advanced economies over the past three
decades were eventually implemented. The implementation rate for elder LP reforms in emerging market
economies is comparable, whereas for PMR-electricity
3The first category can include both cases in which a reform was

not needed and those in which it was needed but was not being considered. Earlier structural reform databases (for instance, Alesina and
others 2023) identify only implemented reforms, with no-reform
observations including both categories (1) and (2).
4There have been barely any attempts to undertake elder LP
reforms in low-income countries, which is not surprising, because
most are still benefiting from a youthful and growing working-age
population or have incipient pension programs.

reform episodes, the share of implemented reforms
is 90 percent for emerging market economies and
for low-income countries. The implementation rate
for migrant integration reform episodes is comparable
across country groups, at about 80 percent.
In addition, in a significant fraction of episodes
that did end in reform implementation, the reform

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

was nonetheless resisted by the public, as evidenced
by strikes, protests, or riots: roughly 22 percent of
migrant integration episodes, 30 percent in the case of
PMR-electricity episodes, and as many as 40 percent for elder LP reform episodes. In many of those
episodes, policymakers had to scale down the scope of
the reform to secure its implementation (for instance,
this occurred in nearly 40 percent of resisted elder
LP reform episodes and in as many as 45 percent of
episodes in the second half of the sample). Moreover,
public resistance need not always preclude implementation, but it may affect the sustainability of a reform.
Indeed, additional analysis reveals that among reforms
that were enacted but later reversed, a higher share had
faced resistance when implemented (Online Annex
Figure 3.2.1).

Strategies for Building Consensus for
Structural Reforms
Earlier studies argue that communication and
consultation efforts aimed at informing voters and
stakeholders of both the need for and the goals of
reform have often played a key role in securing implementation and reducing the chances of policy reversals
(for example, Tompson 2009; OECD 2010). Besides
early engagement with all stakeholders, those studies
also underscore the role that mitigation measures have
played in securing consensus. However, the evidence
on the use of these strategies is drawn largely from
case studies covering a handful of mostly advanced
economies. To shed light on how extensively used these
strategies are and what role they may have played for
securing implementation, this section shows evidence
based on two new indicators (see details in Online
Annex 3.2):
• Use of consultation and communication strategies. An
indicator variable records whether policymakers
resorted to any of several tools—such as consultations, hearings, referendums, or independent
communication agencies—to communicate, engage,
and negotiate with various stakeholders at any point
within a reform episode.
• Complementary and compensatory measures. Analogously, an indicator variable captures whether the
authorities considered any of various mitigating
measures—such as job training programs, temporary
job protections, price subsidies, or grandfathering
clauses—aimed at compensating those negatively
affected by reforms or to offset transition costs.

Note: The figure shows the shares of reform episodes using each strategy by reform
and country income group. AEs = advanced economies; EMEs = emerging market
economies; LICs = low-income countries; LP = labor participation; PMR = product
market regulation.

Although countries in all income groups have
used both sets of strategies across reform areas, in a
significant share of reform episodes (close to half, on
average), the use was not prominent enough to be
captured in the data (Figure 3.3). Advanced economies
appear to have resorted more often to consultation and
communication strategies, compared with their use of
complementary and compensatory measures, although
the share of reform episodes in which they used
these mitigating measures has picked up significantly
since the global financial crisis. In contrast, emerging
market economies and low-income countries seem to
have relied more on complementary and compensatory measures, particularly in PMR-electricity reform
episodes, in which subsidies or price controls were
frequently part of the policy packages.
The heterogeneity in both the use of strategies to
secure consensus and the implementation outcome
across reform episodes raises a natural question:
Has the use of these strategies helped overcome the
challenges of passing reforms? Although causal effects
cannot be convincingly tested with these aggregate
data, an exploration of historical correlations based on
multinomial logit regressions suggests that these strategies are associated with a more than 6 percentage point

The role of reform design strategies documented

5Earlier studies have also documented ambiguous relationships

between the likelihood of reform implementation (with respect to
nonreforming, without distinguishing reform discussions from other
nonreform observations) and potential drivers related to cyclical conditions, macroeconomic policies, and political factors (see discussion
in Duval, Furceri, and Miethe 2020).

increase, on average, in the likelihood of implementing
proposed reforms across policy areas, with stronger
effects for attempts facing resistance (Online Annex
Figure 3.2.2). Indeed, in reform episodes that are met
with public resistance, reaching implementation is
more likely when explicit efforts to consult or communicate with social stakeholders are used than when
they are not used. Also, the use of compensatory and
complementary measures is generally associated with a
higher likelihood of implementing reform proposals in
the case of both resisted and less resisted episodes, with
some differences across reform areas.
This does not mean that the use of these strategies is the only factor determining reform outcomes.
The analysis also finds that the macroeconomic and
political contexts in which reforms are attempted (for
instance, whether a reform is proposed in good times
or after a severe crisis, or at the beginning of a new
administration versus closer to the next elections) can
somewhat influence the likelihood of reform proposals being implemented. However, the correlations are
not always consistent, with the role and significance
of individual variables varying across reform areas
(Online Annex Table 3.2.3).5 In addition, when the
importance of reform strategies is compared with that
of other factors for predicting the implementation
of reform proposals, reform strategies jointly explain
about 28 percent of the implementation likelihood, on
average, across different policy areas (Figure 3.4). This
is relatively large: by comparison, the variables capturing the macroeconomic context or the political context
explain 16 percent and 22 percent, respectively, on
average. Taken together, this suggests that active use of
consultation, communication, and mitigating strategies
is a more robust predictor of implementation success
than the context in which reforms are attempted.

incorporate their concerns when designing reforms.
To shed light on this matter, the chapter uses surveys
of 12,600 individuals from six countries covering two
different policy areas (Online Annex 3.3; Albrizio and
others 2024a, 2024b):
• PMR reforms to enhance private participation and
foster competition in the electricity and telecommunications sectors in emerging market and developing
economies (the survey is conducted in Mexico,
Morocco, and South Africa). Attracting private
investment is critical to narrowing infrastructure
gaps that can affect the ability of these economies
to harness benefits from digitalization and artificial
intelligence technologies (for example, Balza and
others 2020; Devine and others 2021; Cazzaniga
and others 2024). Public attitudes toward these
policies, however, have been notably negative in the
past (for example, Fay and Morrison 2007; Andrés,
Schwartz, and Guasch 2013).
• Migrant integration policies to integrate foreign-born
workers into labor markets in advanced economies
(the survey covers Canada, Italy, and the United
Kingdom), such as improving the recognition of
immigrants’ qualifications and experiences, offering
free language courses and professional training, and

providing job placement programs that connect
immigrants with employers looking for their specific
expertise. These policies can boost labor supply and
productivity amid aging populations (for example,
Aiyar and others 2016; Mitaritonna, Orefice, and
Peri 2017; Chapter 4 of the April 2020 WEO) but
are often resisted on account of various concerns (for
example, Dennison and Dražanová 2018; Grigorieff,
Roth, and Ubfal 2020; Alesina and Tabellini 2024).

Predicting Policy Support: The Role of Beliefs
What drives individuals’ attitudes toward reforms?
Policy preferences can be determined, first, by people’s
socioeconomic characteristics (such as age, education
level, employment, income level, and geographic
location), which underpin their economic self-interest.
They can also be influenced by a wide range of perceptions and beliefs, including those regarding policies
(that is, how much individuals know about policies
and how they think policies may affect outcomes they
care about, such as jobs, prices, and crime rates).
The results from both surveys reveal that individual characteristics do play a role but account for only
6 percent of individuals’ support for PMR reforms
and 11 percent of support for migrant integration
policies (Figure 3.5; Online Annex Figure 3.3.2).
Instead, policy views are driven primarily by individuals’ beliefs and (mis)perceptions, some of which can
72

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

be affected by the design of reforms (Online Annex
3.3.1):
• Not surprisingly, those who believe that productive
activities should be handled primarily by private
firms and that the government should not intervene
in price-setting decisions support PMR reforms, and
overall, market-oriented beliefs account for a substantial share (35 percent) of policy views. Respondents who perceive the distribution of income in
their country as unfair are less supportive. And
distributional concerns, together with trust and perceptions on corruption, weigh as much as individual
characteristics in explaining support.
• Stereotypes about immigrants play a key role in
explaining individuals’ support for migrant integration policies. Respondents who have a positive view
of immigrants (for example, that they are hardworking), associate immigrants with refugees, or think
that immigration can have a positive economic
and cultural effect are more likely to support these
policies, whereas the opposite is true for those who
associate immigrants with illegal workers or a negative economic or cultural outcome.
• Importantly, knowledge about and perceptions of
the effect of policies explain more than 50 percent
of support for migrant integration policies. Respondents who correctly identify policies for better
integrating foreign-born workers or who believe
that integrating immigrants can be beneficial for the

economy are more likely to support such policies.
Knowledge and perceptions of policies also explain
the lion’s share (37 percent) of support for PMR
reforms. Individuals are more likely to support the
reform if they believe that private firms competing
in the sector will lead to lower prices, higher quality,
or broader access to electricity or telecommunications services.
The importance of beliefs in shaping policy support
extends beyond the areas included in this study. For
example, Duval and others (2024) find that beliefs play
a bigger role in explaining attitudes toward employment protection legislation than individual socioeconomic characteristics (such as employment status or
education level). Dechezleprêtre and others (2022) and
Dabla-Norris and others (2023) find similar results for
climate policies.

Information Strategies to Boost Reform
Acceptability
Because knowledge and perceptions of policies
strongly influence individuals’ attitudes toward
structural reforms, this section uses an experimental
setup to investigate how providing information about
policies affects support for reforms. Survey respondents are randomly assigned at the country level
to different groups before their perceptions of and
views about policies are elicited in order to test three
hypotheses, reported in Table 3.1, regarding the role
of information strategies in boosting policy support:
(1) providing information on the costs of not reforming (status quo hypothesis), (2) explaining the effect of
policies (effect-of-policies hypothesis), and (3) providing a
real-life narrative of immigrants’ experiences (empathy
hypothesis). Comparing responses on policy support by

individuals who receive an information treatment at
random with responses of those who do not makes it
possible to causally test these hypotheses.6
Testing the status quo hypothesis is particularly
relevant for PMR reforms, because these often entail
opportunity costs (for example, a missed opportunity
to improve competitiveness), which individuals find
harder to visualize than actual costs of not reforming, as in the case of unsustainable pension programs
(Tompson 2009). The results show that raising
awareness of the need for reform has a positive impact
on support for PMR reforms in the electricity sector
(Figure 3.6). Compared with that in the control group,
support increases by 4.5 percentage points for respondents who receive the status quo treatment.7 The effect
is also positive, but not statistically significant, for the
telecommunications sector. This may reflect that, on
average, respondents perceive private participation as
higher in the telecommunications sector, so simply
informing them that there is room for improvement
does not necessarily change their views on allowing
private firms to operate in the sector.
However, when information about the need for
reform is complemented with research-based evidence on the effect that PMR reforms have had on
6The analysis controls for a rich set of individual characteristics, beliefs and perceptions, and country fixed effects (Online
Annex 3.3.2). Moreover, although the survey questions can elicit
individuals’ policy support directly, one concern is that self-reported
preferences may not match real behavior. Several studies have
nonetheless shown that when both survey responses and real-world
behaviors can be measured, they tend to correlate (for example, Fehr,
Epper, and Senn 2021). Although the setting here does not allow
real-world behavior to be measured, the survey includes real-stakes
questions (for example, gathering willingness to sign a petition) that
can serve as a proxy. The results are reported in Online Annex 3.3.2.
7In all treatments, respondents are given the sources for the evidence on the effect of policies and links to the relevant publications.
Examples of treatments are reported in Online Annex 3.3.2.

price, quality, and access to electricity and telecommunications services in other countries, the effect is
stronger and statistically significant in regard to both
sectors (the status quo + effect of policies treatment in
Figure 3.6), lending support to the effect-of-policies
hypothesis. The share of respondents who would support PMR reforms increases by almost 16 percentage
points, on average, across sectors, from 41.4 percent
in the control group to 57.1 percent among those
who receive the treatment.8 This additional support is
equivalent to 46.7 percent of the share of respondents
who oppose PMR reforms in the control group.
Similarly, the share of respondents who would support
migrant integration policies increases by about 9 percentage points between the control group and those who
receive the effect-of-policies treatment (and the effect is
statistically significant).9 The treatment effect is also
equivalent to 30 percent of the share of respondents who
8Providing information about the benefits of easing regulation has
also been found to increase support for labor market reforms (see
Duval and others 2024).
9The effect-of-policies treatment is designed to address four
potential misperceptions related to key drivers of attitudes toward
immigration identified in the literature: labor market concerns,
welfare concerns, security concerns, and cultural concerns (Alesina
and Tabellini 2024; Dustmann and Preston 2007; Dennison and
Dražanová 2018; Dražanová 2020; Haaland and Roth 2020).

74

oppose migrant integration policies in the control group.
Moreover, the effect on reform support is even larger
(10.5 percentage points) when respondents are given an
explanation of the mechanisms underlying the policy
effects under the effect of policies + mechanism treatment
(equivalent to about 42 percent of the share opposed in
the control group). Importantly, heterogeneous analysis
shows that explaining how policies work is particularly effective in shifting support among respondents
with negative stereotypes of immigrants and politically
right-leaning respondents (Online Annex Table 3.3.2).
Additional results confirm that the information
treatment in both surveys influences reform support by
addressing individuals’ misperceptions about the effect
of policies. It has a statistically significant and large effect
on the share of respondents in the PMR survey who
perceive competition in the provision of electricity and
telecommunications services as beneficial for consumers
(Online Annex Table 3.3.1). Similarly, respondents who
receive either of the two treatments on the effects of policies are significantly more likely to believe that policies
to integrate immigrant workers can have a positive effect
on natives’ jobs, public finances, and crime rates (Online
Annex Table 3.3.2). The effect is stronger in particular
for crime rates, suggesting that misperceptions about
foreign-born workers and crime are a key channel for
support for policies related to migrants.
The empathy hypothesis is particularly relevant in the
context of immigration, in which negative attitudes
are often driven by concerns about cultural and work
ethic differences (Dennison and Dražanová 2018;
Alesina, Miano, and Stantcheva 2023). The treatment
evaluates whether appealing to empathy, by highlighting real-life examples of policy-related obstacles faced
by immigrants in entering the labor market, has a
different impact than providing information on the
benefits of integration policies. The treatment is indeed
effective in increasing support for migrant integration
policies, but with a less pronounced effect than for the
effect-of-policies treatment.
Taken together, the survey experiments show that
beliefs not only play a key role in driving reform
support but can also be shaped by policy interventions.
Providing clear information on the impact of policies is
particularly effective in increasing support for reforms.10
10Although misinformation campaigns can induce misperceptions
and decrease policy support (for instance, Di Tella, Galiani, and
Schargrodsky 2012; Alesina and Tabellini 2024), this does not lessen the
case for enhancing information efforts by policymakers seeking reform.

Note: The blue bars show the distribution of respondents’ reasons for not supporting the reform (control group only). The yellow (red) bars display the proportion of these
respondents that would opt to support (remain against) policies if offered mitigating measures (Online Annex 3.3.3). PMR = product market regulation.

Understanding Individuals’ Concerns to
Improve Policy Design
Merely explaining the need to reform and how
policies can improve outcomes is not enough to secure
comprehensive support. Addressing distributional concerns, unintended side effects, and the short-term costs
of reforms requires additional strategies, as reflected
by the evidence that compensatory or complementary
measures have often helped tilt the balance toward
securing reform implementation. To shed light on
these strategies, the surveys zoom in on individuals
who say they would not support policy change. This
helps to (1) identify the main reasons for nonsupport
and (2) test whether complementing reforms with
mitigating measures would change their support.
When responses are grouped according to whether
individuals are concerned that policy changes would
hurt them directly (personal concerns) or would hurt
their communities (societal concerns), the results from
the two surveys indicate that societal concerns play a
much larger role (Figure 3.7).
• The two most cited concerns against PMR reforms are
consequences for the poorest households in terms of
service affordability and access if private companies
are permitted to manage the sector. Taken together,
all societal concerns account for more than half of
total responses. In turn, self-interest or personal

concerns about the price or quality of services or the
possibility of losing one’s job represent 22 percent of
responses.
• The primary reasons for not supporting migrant
integration policies are concerns about fairness—
specifically, the belief that it is unfair to assist
immigrants when many locals struggle to find
jobs—followed by worries that public services like
hospitals, schools, and public transport may become
overcrowded. Self-interest concerns account for
30 percent of responses, with access to public services
or housing featuring more prominently than jobs.
Importantly, the results indicate that, irrespective of
the concerns raised by respondents, offering tailored
complementary and compensatory measures can significantly foster support for reforms (Online Annex 3.3.3).
Although results should be interpreted as indicative rather
than causal evidence, 50–80 percent of respondents in the
control group initially opposed to PMR reforms indicate
they would change their stance toward support if mitigating measures were taken to address their concerns—for
example, respondents who express concerns about the
cost and quality of utility services following PMR reforms
are asked if they would change their support, assuming
the government committed to creating an independent
regulatory agency (Figure 3.7, panel 1). Further analysis

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

shows that mitigating measures play an important role
in boosting support from individuals who may fear job
losses from PMR reforms, such as workers in public utility
companies or individuals with close connections to them.
The share of respondents who would change their
stance varies more across specific concerns and is generally somewhat lower for those initially against migrant
integration policies, but still sizable, at about 50 percent,
on average (Figure 3.7, panel 2). One of the complementary policies that would significantly increase support is international coordination and cooperation. The
EU Temporary Protection Directive, enacted in response
to the massive inflow of immigrants during the war
in Ukraine, is a good example of a cross-country agreement that, together with member states’ policies aimed
at removing barriers to accessing labor markets, has
helped achieve high employment rates for foreign-born
workers in record time (Box 3.1).
Individuals who say they would still oppose reforms
mostly cite reasons related to trust in the parties
involved and doubts about institutions’ ability to
implement reforms or mitigating measures effectively
(Online Annex Table 3.3.3). This is in line with
results in OECD (2024) showing that, on average,
only 39 percent of the population in a country finds
it likely that the government will clearly explain how
individuals will be affected by a reform, with lower
shares in countries where trust in government is
weaker. These findings highlight the importance of
designing mechanisms that build trust in the reform
process. Examples of such mechanisms include the use
of crowdsourcing or participatory budgeting to allow
collective understanding, design, and oversight of the
reform and compensatory measures (OECD 2022), or
the use of pilot cases, as discussed in the next section.
The findings also underscore that strengthening trust
in public institutions through reforms to address
governance and corruption vulnerabilities, as advocated
in IMF engagement with member countries (see IMF
1997, 2018), can also pave the way for the successful
implementation of labor and product market reforms.

confirms that effective communication of the need for
reform and how policies work can shift individuals’
attitudes toward reforms. It also highlights the need
to complement reforms with additional measures to
address concerns. But how have these strategies been
deployed in practice? And what other tools and institutions have helped policymakers sustain reform efforts?
To shed light on these questions, this section examines
11 reform episodes in countries of different income
levels (Table 3.2; Online Annex 3.4). To facilitate
comparability, the analysis focuses on one policy field,
employment protection legislation (EPL), in which it
has proved particularly difficult to enact reforms over
the past four decades. It is also a policy area in which
intertemporal trade-offs can lead to strong resistance
and political gridlock: the benefits of deregulation
accrue only gradually over time, whereas deregulation
can lead to higher unemployment and lower wages
in the short term (Blanchard and Giavazzi 2003).
Understanding what has helped to build consensus
and overcome political resistance in this context can
be particularly useful for other reform areas that entail
similar trade-offs.

Building Consensus for Reform
Despite varying outcomes in terms of implementation status, a commonality among the majority of the
successfully legislated reforms has been the achievement of some level of consensus prior to legislation.

CHAPTER 3

UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS

In some instances, the necessity for reform was demonstrated by economic crises, such as Bolivia’s hyperinflation crisis in the 1980s or high unemployment rates
in countries such as Denmark (early 1990s), Germany
(early 2000s), and France (after the euro area crisis).
These situations made it clear that the status quo was
unsustainable and changes were needed to revive the
labor market and the economy. However, the macroeconomic context alone was neither a sufficient nor
a necessary condition for the reforms. Governments
needed to employ multiple approaches to successfully
garner consensus:
• Securing explicit electoral mandates for reform. A
strong electoral mandate for policy changes, underpinned by effective communication and far-reaching
efforts to convince voters and stakeholders of the
need for reform during an electoral campaign, was
instrumental in several instances for EPL reform
success (Tompson 2009). For example, the economic policy agenda that President Emmanuel
Macron proposed for the 2017 French presidential
election included a labor reform aimed at introducing flexibility in hours worked and collective
bargaining, with the goal of reducing unemployment to 7 percent by 2022. In India’s 2014 elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party campaigned on
the “Gujarat model” for growth and development,
featuring business-friendly policies with simplified
regulatory frameworks and relatively flexible labor
laws to attract industries. Successful election outcomes may have signaled some public buy-in of the
new government’s economic policy agenda. Strong
electoral campaigns also helped in regard to reforms
in Georgia, Mexico, and Peru.
• Extensive communication with key stakeholders.
Engaging early with key stakeholders, such as trade
unions and business associations, has also been
an effective approach toward communicating the
need for EPL reforms. In Denmark, continuous
social dialogue and tripartite negotiations involving workers, employers, and the government have
been a long-standing practice with respect to labor
market issues (Petersen 1998). In France, the 2007
Larcher Act mandated national-level negotiations
between the government and social partners regarding labor law matters, but the 2016 El Khomri law
was adopted without prior negotiations and was
followed by protests (Gazier 2019).
• Pilot cases. Using pilot cases, with key measures
usually deployed first in only a few regions, can help

demonstrate the benefits of reforms and build public
confidence, particularly for EPL reforms, which often
involve substantial up-front costs with delayed and
indirect benefits. For instance, pilot projects and evaluations have commonly been employed in Denmark
when introducing new labor market measures, such
as paid leave arrangements (Madsen 1999) and public
employment services (Hendeliowitz and Woollhead
2007). Similarly, in India, key principles deployed in
the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan, which pioneered
more flexible labor laws, skill development initiatives,
and job creation strategies, were later adopted for
national labor law reforms.
• Policy research and international comparisons. In Bolivia
and Brazil, for instance, policy analysis by independent researchers helped raise awareness about how
much more rigid these countries’ labor markets were
compared with those of peers and how deregulation
could enhance productivity growth and competitiveness. International financial institutions also played
a crucial role in some cases by raising awareness and
providing analysis that local authorities could leverage. For example, the IMF stressed the importance of
easing restrictive labor laws in India during bilateral
consultations (see IMF 2012, 2013, 2014). Similarly,
the IMF identified labor market rigidities as the most
challenging structural problem in Germany (IMF
2001) in the early 2000s, and the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development identified
comprehensive labor reform in Germany (OECD
2001) and France (OECD 2015) as top priorities.
No single approach has been sufficient on its own to
build a strong case for reforms. In nearly all episodes,
governments have had to adopt multiple strategies to
build consensus, especially when facing strong resistance. This has been particularly evident when trade
unions were politically influential yet fragmented—
with each representing a small fraction of the labor
force and thus hesitant to support any reform that did
not directly benefit its own members, even if beneficial
for the broader workforce—as in Bolivia and India,
or when achieving consensus required agreements at
multiple levels. For example, in India, full implementation of new labor codes required both federal and
state-level agreements. And sometimes reform adoption
has built on numerous previous reform attempts across
different administrations, as in Brazil, where attempts
to increase labor market flexibility can be traced back
to the 1990s (de Oliveira 2018).

Carefully Crafted Policy Design
The case studies reviewed indicate that, besides
securing strong consensus, a well-articulated policy
design that balances the needs of different social interest
groups is critical to implementing sustainable reforms.
One particularly effective approach is to involve social
partners in negotiations during the policy design stage.
In Denmark, for instance, key policy changes have often
been the result of tripartite negotiations among business
associations, trade unions, and the government. Similarly,
key principles in Mexico’s 2012 labor reform were based
on extensive parliamentary negotiations among political
parties representing diverse social interest groups.
To ease the negative effect of less stringent employment protection on workers, several countries have
supplemented flexibility-enhancing reforms with
compensatory measures, such as improved social security and unemployment benefits (Online Annex Table
3.4.1). Examples include Brazil, Denmark, France,
Germany, and Korea. Complementary measures to
facilitate the reallocation of workers, such as enhanced
active labor market policies and training programs,
have been included in episodes in Denmark, France,
Germany, and Vietnam. These measures have often
helped garner support for EPL reforms.
Independent research institutes and think tanks can
also play a crucial role in facilitating better policy design
and communicating the benefits of labor reforms to the
public. For instance, during Germany’s Hartz reforms,
the economic research institutes RWI and ZEW were
commissioned to develop a conceptual framework
for evaluating draft policies (Hopp 2019). In France,
independent institutions such as France Stratégie and
the CESE not only conduct labor market analyses and
policy evaluation but also advise the government and
facilitate dialogue with various sectors of society.

Incremental Implementation
Incremental rollout of reform measures, starting
with focused areas that do not immediately threaten
core benefits of several social groups, is often associated
with stronger sustainability of reforms. For instance,
an important focus of Brazil’s reform was on reducing
excessive labor litigation costs, India’s labor reform efforts
began with consolidating and standardizing minimum
wage regulations across all sectors, and France started
with simplifying collective bargaining. In Denmark,
although the first wave of labor reforms occurred in
the early to mid-1990s, subsequent reforms, including
measures targeting youth and long-term unemployment,
78

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

extended into the 2010s. Conversely, when governments
have pursued multiple substantial market-oriented
reforms simultaneously (Online Annex Table 3.4.1),
reform implementation has usually been less successful:
in Bolivia and Georgia, for instance, some of the reforms
that were enacted were eventually reversed. This could
reflect the fact that negotiating extensively in several
reform areas at the same time eventually exhausts governments’ political capital or that fast-track implementation
of multiple substantial reforms does not allow governments to adequately balance social interests.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Policymakers worldwide are under pressure to revive
improvements in living standards and ensure their
economies flourish amid ongoing structural changes
that present both opportunities and challenges. In this
context, it is critical to implement policies and reforms
that boost labor participation and facilitate the reallocation of labor and capital to high-productivity firms
and growing sectors. Historically, gaining the necessary
social and political support to enact and sustain these
policies and reforms has been a formidable challenge.
This chapter presents several strategies that policymakers can employ to navigate this challenge, enhance the
social acceptability of their reform agendas, and thereby
increase the chances of successful implementation.
Although the context in which reforms are
attempted can sometimes influence the outcomes, it is
by no means determinant. Historical evidence shows
that active use of multipronged strategies to build consensus is a more reliable predictor of implementation
success. These strategies include consultation and communication efforts and mitigating measures to compensate those affected by reforms. However, whether
individuals see themselves as winners or losers with
regard to prospective policy changes is not determined
solely by objective socioeconomic characteristics—such
as employment status, education level, or income.
Individuals’ views on policies—and thus the social
acceptability of reforms—are driven largely by beliefs
such as trust in government and institutions, distributional concerns, and perceptions about the effects
of policies on themselves and their communities (for
example, the overall availability of jobs, access to public services for the neediest, and national security).
Importantly, the chapter’s analysis, based on randomized survey experiments, shows that certain communication interventions can shift individuals’ perceptions and
policy views. First, informing them about the cost of not

CHAPTER 3

UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS

undertaking necessary structural reforms raises awareness
of the need for the reforms and increases support for
policy change. Second, trustworthy communication on
the economic effects of policies is effective in correcting
misperceptions. For instance, providing research-based
evidence on the impact on crime rates of granting
work permits to foreign-born workers significantly
boosts support for policies to facilitate these workers’
integration into labor markets. Although the survey
experiments conducted for this chapter focus on specific
policies, the consistency of results across distinct policy
fields and countries at different stages of development
lends support to the general applicability of their policy
implications.
The lessons from the chapter’s survey analysis and
review of country-specific reform episodes extend far
beyond simply improving communication or marketing reforms. An effective communication strategy must
be supported by a strong institutional framework that
fosters trust among all stakeholders and the general population. For instance, the chapter’s review of historical
cases underscores the importance of independent policy
research to build awareness of the need for reform and
to achieve consensus. Establishing credible and independent public bodies—such as the CPB Netherlands
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, the Productivity
Commission in Australia, or the Conseil d’orientation
des retraites in France—that conduct and validate policy
analysis can be particularly helpful (Tompson 2009).
At the same time, dialogue needs to take place in
both directions. For instance, the case studies examined
in the chapter indicate that not only consultation with
stakeholders, but also their involvement in the reform
design stage, plays a key role for reform sustainability.
Policymakers across the globe are appropriately scaling
up their toolkits to incorporate citizens’ views into the
policy design process. Examples of tools deployed to
foster an effective two-way dialogue include large-scale
surveys (Blanchard and Tirole 2021), scenario planning
(Volkery and Ribeiro 2009), participatory budgeting
(OECD 2022; Nicol and Burn-Murdoch 2024), laboratories to evaluate policies through focus groups and
pilots (such as the Avalua·lab in Valencia), and open
town hall meetings (such as the Grand débat national
organized in response to the Yellow Vest movement
in France). New civic technologies, such as digital
community engagement platforms, are also opening
the potential to improve representation and citizen
participation processes (see further discussion and
examples in Stankova 2019 and OECD 2022). These
tools can help identify individuals’ concerns and find

mitigating measures that increase reforms’ acceptability.
As the chapter’s survey results show, these measures do
not always involve compensating those who lose out,
which needs to be balanced against fiscal constraints.
Sometimes they entail providing the necessary institutional framework and participatory mechanisms to
build trust regarding a reform, which can be achieved
even in a fiscally constrained environment.
Finally, the chapter’s findings underscore how lack of
trust can drive resistance to policy change, even when
the benefits of reforms are explained and mitigating
measures are considered. For instance, in the context of
the experimental surveys discussed in the chapter, the
main reason cited by respondents for ultimately not
supporting policy change is lack of trust in the parties
involved in the reform and, notably, skepticism about
governments’ ability to implement an adequate reform
or deliver mitigating measures. Some mechanism designs
have proved useful for reducing mistrust in the context
of specific reforms. For instance, the Islamic Republic of
Iran handed out cash transfers ahead of phasing out subsidies in a 2010 reform (Guillaume, Zytek, and Farzin
2011). Although funds from the transfers could not be
withdrawn until the reform was implemented, the fact
that individuals could see the deposits in their accounts
raised confidence regarding the compensation plan.
However, changing deep-rooted values, like trust, is not
an easy task and takes time (Tabellini 2008). Countries
that manage to leverage early engagement and effective
communication to unlock reform support typically have
a high degree of mutual trust rooted in many decades of
dialogue among social partners.
Previous IMF studies have underscored the importance of “first-generation” governance reforms—such as
enhancing the rule of law, controlling corruption, and
establishing an impartial public administration—for
economic growth (see Chapter 3 of the October 2019
WEO; and Budina and others 2023). The findings in
this chapter indicate that strengthening governance can
also be critical to successful passage of second-generation
reforms in product and labor markets. The importance
of carefully designing policy changes and advancing
governance reforms to overcome trust deficits also needs
to be reflected in IMF program design.
In summary, effective reform design should involve
thorough consultation and communication. Expanding
policymaking toolkits to enable a more participative
reform process not only strengthens public understanding of reform proposals but also reinforces trust in
public institutions, leading to greater social acceptance
and successful implementation of policies.

Box 3.1. Policies to Facilitate the Integration of Ukrainian Refugees into the
European Labor Market: Early Evidence
The integration of immigrants into the EU labor
market during 2022–23 was significantly faster
than in the past. Following a slump in global migration as the pandemic shut down borders, immigration
into the EU reached a historic high in 2022—driven
by more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine—and
remained above prepandemic levels in 2023. About
two-thirds of jobs created between the end of 2019
and the end of 2023 were filled by non-EU citizens, even as the unemployment rate for EU citizens
remained at record lows.1 Available data suggest that
Ukrainian refugees integrated into EU labor markets
noticeably faster than previous waves of refugees.
Several countries have already estimated employment
rates among Ukrainian refugees at about or above
50 percent, which is usually achieved only five or
more years after arrival (OECD 2023). Migrants have
helped meet unprecedented labor demand during this
period.
Among other factors, the EU Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), along with member states’
efforts, played a crucial role in the swift integration of foreign-born workers in the recent episode.
The TPD provided immediate protection and rights
across countries, including residency rights, access to
housing and social welfare assistance, medical or other
assistance, and means of subsistence. At the same time,
many EU member states removed barriers to ensure

access to the labor market.2 For instance, they simplified entry requirements for certain regulated professions and provided a range of measures to facilitate
access to the labor market, including language courses,
skills validation and recognition of qualifications, skills
mapping, financial incentives for employers to recruit
TPD beneficiaries, and on-the-job training (EMN
2024). Other factors also facilitated swift labor market
integration during the recent episode. First, survey
data show that individuals displaced from Ukraine are
highly educated, with most having a tertiary education (Caselli and others 2024). Second, a tight labor
market in many EU countries also supported fast
integration. Nevertheless, as is common in regard to
immigrants, there is evidence of widespread worker
overqualification and skills mismatches (EMN 2024),
which points to further room for improvement in
immigrant integration policies.
The recent experience offers important policy
lessons. Granting asylum seekers early access to private
and public sector labor markets and self-employment,
as the current TPD has done for Ukrainian refugees,
is a key prerequisite for their speedy integration into
workforces (Aiyar and others 2016). The availability of
language courses is also crucial to enabling immigrants
to overcome one of the most important barriers to
obtaining a job. Finally, simplified entry requirements
for certain regulated professions, skills validation,
and recognition of qualifications are also important
elements for successful integration of refugees.
2For specific country examples, see EMN (2024) and Caselli
and others (2024).

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises eight
sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data
and Conventions, Country Notes, Classification of Economies, General Features and Composition
of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions
underlying the estimates and projections for 2024–25.
The second section briefly describes the changes to
the database and statistical tables since the April 2024
World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third section
offers a general description of the data and the conventions used for calculating country group composites.
The fourth section presents selected key information
for each country. The fifth section summarizes the classification of economies in the various groups presented
in the WEO, and the sixth section explains that classification in further detail. The seventh section provides
information on methods and reporting standards for
the member countries’ national account and government finance indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. Statistical Appendix A is included here;
Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf.
org/en/Publications/WEO.
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through October 7, 2024, but
may not reflect the latest published data in all cases.
For the date of the last data update for each economy,
please refer to the notes provided in the online WEO
database. The figures for 2024–25 are shown with the
same degree of precision as the historical figures solely
for convenience; because they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels measured during July 30, 2024–August 27,
2024. For 2024 and 2025 these assumptions imply
average US dollar–special drawing right conversion
rates of 1.331 and 1.341, US dollar–euro conversion

rates1 of 1.090 and 1.097, and yen–US dollar conversion rates of 150.0 and 143.6, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $81.29
a barrel in 2024 and $72.84 a barrel in 2025.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 5.4 percent in 2024 and 3.9 percent in
2025, that for the euro area will average 3.5 percent in
2024 and 2.8 percent in 2025, and that for Japan will
average 0.1 percent in 2024 and 0.5 percent in 2025.
Further it is assumed that the 10-year government bond
yield for the United States will average 4.1 percent in
2024 and 3.5 percent in 2025, that for the euro area
will average 2.4 percent in 2024 and 2.5 percent in
2025, and that for Japan will average 1.0 percent in
2024 and 1.3 percent in 2025.

What’s New
• Following the recent release of the 2021 survey by the
World Bank Group’s International Comparison Program for new purchasing-power-parity benchmarks,
the WEO’s estimates of purchasing-power-parity
weights and GDP valued at purchasing power parity
have been updated. For more details, see Box A2.
• For Bangladesh, fiscal year estimates of real GDP
and purchasing-power-parity GDP are now used in
country group aggregates.
• For Zimbabwe, the authorities have recently redenominated their national accounts statistics following the introduction on April 5, 2024, of a new
national currency, the Zimbabwe gold, replacing the
Zimbabwe dollar. The use of the Zimbabwe dollar
ceased on April 30, 2024.
1In regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31, 1998, the

Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999,
the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro and currencies
of the member countries adopting the euro are as described in Box 5.4
of the October 1998 WEO. See that box as well for details on how the
conversion rates were established. For the most recent table of fixed conversion rates, see the Statistical Appendix of the April 2023 WEO.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented
in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version
of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide, and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM
2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, monetary developments, financial
sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when revised versions of the manuals
are released. However, full concordance with the most
recent versions of the manuals is ultimately dependent
on the provision by national statistical compilers of
revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are
only partly adapted to the most recent versions of these
manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion
to the updated standards will have only a small impact
on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partly adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a number of years.2
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
2Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European

System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each
country adheres.

86

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

staff estimates. While attempts are made to align data
on gross and net debt with the definitions in the
GFSM 2014, as a result of data limitations or specific
country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the formal definitions. Although every effort
is made to ensure the WEO data are relevant and
internationally comparable, differences in both sectoral
and instrument coverage mean that the data are not
universally comparable. As more information becomes
available, changes in either data sources or instrument
coverage can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes substantial. For clarification on the deviations
in sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the
metadata for the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.4 For the aggregation
of inflation in advanced economies (and subgroups),
annual rates are simple percent changes from the
previous years; for the aggregation of world inflation
and inflation in emerging market and developing
economies (and subgroups), annual rates are based on
logarithmic differences.
3Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and com-

modity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based
on the simple arithmetic average.
4See Box A2 in the Statistical Appendix of the October 2024 WEO
for a summary of the revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights
as well as Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO, “Revised Purchasing
Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update, Appendix 1.1
of the April 2008 WEO, Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO, Box A1 of
the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May 1993 WEO. See also
Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power
Parity Based Weights for the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies
for the World Economic Outlook (Washington, DC: International
Monetary Fund, December 1993), 106–23.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing-­
power-parity terms are sums of individual country data
after conversion to international dollars in the years
indicated.
Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in transactions within the area. Unadjusted annual
GDP data are used for the euro area and for the majority of individual countries, except Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the US
dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total
world or group exports or imports (in the preceding
year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data.
For some countries, the figures for 2023 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government
finance, and balance of payments for each country.

Country Notes
Afghanistan: Data for 2021–23 are reported for
selected indicators, with estimates for fiscal data. Estimates and projections for 2024–29 are omitted because
of an unusually high degree of uncertainty given that
the IMF has paused its engagement with Afghanistan

owing to a lack of clarity within the international
community regarding the recognition of a government
in the country. Data reported in the WEO contain a
structural break in 2021 as a result of the change from
calendar year to solar year reporting; the actual reported
GDP growth rate for solar year 2021 is –20.7 percent.
Algeria: Total government expenditure and net
lending/borrowing include net lending by the government, which mostly reflects support to the pension
system and other public sector entities.
Argentina: The official national consumer price index
(CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier periods,
CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires
Area CPI (prior to December 2013); the national CPI
(IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015); the City
of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016);
and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to
December 2016). Given limited comparability of these
series because of differences in geographic coverage,
weights, sampling, and methodology, the WEO does
not report average CPI inflation for 2014–16 and endof-period inflation for 2015–16. Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor market data starting
in the fourth quarter of 2015, and new series became
available starting in the second quarter of 2016.
Costa Rica: The central government definition was
expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include 51 public
entities in accordance with Law 9524. Data back to
2019 are adjusted for comparability.
Dominican Republic: The fiscal series have the
following coverage: public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes the central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are
for the central government.
Eritrea: Data and projections for 2020–29 are
excluded from the database because of constraints in
data reporting.
India: Real GDP growth rates are calculated in accordance with national accounts with base year 2011/12.
Iran: Historical figures for nominal GDP in US
dollars are computed using the official exchange rate
up to 2017. From 2018 onward, the NIMA (the
country’s domestic Forex Management Integrated System) exchange rate, rather than the official exchange
rate, is used to convert nominal rial GDP figures into
US dollars. The IMF staff assesses that the NIMA rate
better reflects the transaction-value-weighted exchange
rate in the economy over that period of time.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

Israel: Projections are subject to heightened uncertainty owing to the conflict in the region and thus may
undergo revisions.
Lebanon: Fiscal and national accounts data for
2022–23 as well as debt data for 2023 are IMF staff
estimates and not provided by the national authorities.
Estimates and projections for 2024–29 are omitted
owing to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
Sierra Leone: Although the currency was redenominated on July 1, 2022, local currency data are
expressed in the old leone for the October 2024 WEO.
Sri Lanka: Data and projections for 2023–29 are
excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on restructuring of sovereign debt.
Sudan: Projections reflect the IMF staff ’s analysis
based on the assumption that the ongoing conflict
will terminate by the end of 2024 and that reengagement and reconstruction will commence shortly
thereafter. Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after
July 9; data for 2012 and onward pertain to the
current Sudan.
Syria: Data are excluded from 2011 onward because
of the uncertain political situation.
Timor-Leste: Published data for real GDP refer to
non-oil real GDP, while published data for nominal
GDP refer to total nominal GDP.
Turkmenistan: Real GDP data are IMF staff estimates compiled in line with international methodologies (SNA), using official estimates and sources as well
as United Nations and World Bank databases. Estimates of and projections for the fiscal balance exclude
receipts from domestic bond issuances as well as
privatization operations, in line with GFSM 2014. The
authorities’ official estimates for fiscal accounts, which
are compiled using domestic statistical methodologies,
include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as
part of government revenues.
Ukraine: Revised data for national accounts are
available for 2000 and after and exclude Crimea and
Sevastopol from 2010 onward.
Uruguay: In December 2020 the authorities began
reporting national accounts data according to the SNA
2008, with base year of 2016. The new series begin
in 2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF staff ’s best
effort to preserve previously reported data and avoid
structural breaks.
Starting in October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension
system received transfers in the context of Law 19,590
of 2017, which compensates persons affected by the
creation of the country’s mixed pension system. These
funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the
88

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data for 2018–22 are
affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2
percent of GDP in 2018, 1.0 percent of GDP in 2019,
0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, 0.3 percent of GDP in
2021, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2022, and 0 percent
thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further
details.5 The disclaimer about the public pension
system applies only to the revenues and net lending/
borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In
Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes
the central government, local government, social security funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco
de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were also revised
accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—
which excludes the central bank—assets and liabilities
held by the nonfinancial public sector for which the
counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in
debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued
in the past by the government to the central bank are
now part of the nonfinancial public sector debt.
Venezuela: Projecting the economic outlook,
including assessing past and current economic developments used as the basis for the projections, is rendered
difficult by the lack of discussions with the authorities
(the most recent Article IV consultation took place in
2004), incomplete metadata for limited reported statistics, and difficulties in reconciling reported indicators
with economic developments. The fiscal accounts
include the budgetary central government; social
security; FOGADE (the country’s deposit insurance
institution); and a reduced set of public enterprises,
including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. Following some
methodological upgrades to achieve a more robust
nominal GDP, historical data and indicators expressed
as a percentage of GDP have been revised from 2012
onward. For most indicators, data for 2018–22 are
IMF staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation
and the paucity of reported data mean that the IMF
staff ’s projected macroeconomic indicators should be
interpreted with caution. Broad uncertainty surrounds
these projections. Venezuela’s consumer prices are
excluded from all WEO group composites.
West Bank and Gaza: Projections for 2024–29 are
excluded from publication owing to the unusually high
5Uruguay: Staff Report for the 2018 Article IV Consultation, Country Report 19/64 (Washington, DC: International Monetary Fund,
February 2019).

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

degree of uncertainty. Annual data for the unemployment rate are available up to 2022.
Zimbabwe: The Zimbabwe authorities have recently
redenominated their national accounts statistics
following the introduction on April 5, 2024, of a new
national currency, the Zimbabwe gold, replacing the
Zimbabwe dollar. The use of the Zimbabwe dollar
ceased on April 30, 2024.

Classification of Economies
Summary of the Economy Classification
The economy classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.6
This classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, and has evolved over time. The
objective is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data. Table
A provides an overview of the classification, showing
the number of economies in each group by region and
summarizing some key indicators of their relative size
(GDP valued at purchasing power parity, total exports
of goods and services, and population).
Some economies remain outside the classification
and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba
and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are
examples of economies that are not IMF members, and
the IMF therefore does not monitor them.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of the
euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup. Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area cover
the current members for all years, even though the
membership has increased over time.
6As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (155) comprises all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies employed in the WEO are
emerging and developing Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to as “central and
eastern Europe”); Latin America and the Caribbean;
Middle East and Central Asia (which comprises the
regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and
Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan);
and sub-Saharan Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction
between net creditor and net debtor economies. Tables
D and E show the detailed composition of emerging
market and developing economies in the regional and
analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2019 and 2023.
The financial and income criteria focus on net
creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries (LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as
net debtors when their latest net international investment position, where available, was less than zero or
their current account balance accumulations from
1972 (or earliest available data) to 2023 were negative.
Net debtor economies are further differentiated on the
basis of experience with debt servicing.7
The HIPC group comprises the countries that are
or have been considered by the IMF and the World
Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as
7During 2019–23, 41 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2019–23.

the HIPC Initiative, which aims to reduce the external
debt burdens of all the eligible HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short period of time.8 Many
of these countries have already benefited from debt
relief and have graduated from the initiative.
8See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and
Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (based on
$2,700 in 2017 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method and updated following new information in
early 2024), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be
widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs are those emerging market and developing economies not classified as LIDCs.

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for
Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions
and projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget has been announced, projections incorporate
policy measures judged likely to be implemented.
The medium-term fiscal projections are similarly
based on a judgment about policies’ most likely
path. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions
used in regard to some of the advanced economies
follow. (See also Tables B5 to B9 in the online
section of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal
net lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the
available information regarding budget outturn,
budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets
for the federal government; on fiscal measures
announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff
macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the
fiscal year (FY)2024/25 budgets published by the
Commonwealth government and the respective
state/territory governments, and the IMF staff ’s
estimates and projections.
1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is
the actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical
output, corrected for one-time and other factors, such as asset
and commodity prices and output composition effects. Changes
in the structural balance consequently include effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in interest rates
and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net
lending/borrowing. The computations of structural balances are
based on the IMF staff ’s estimates of potential GDP and revenue
and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of the October 1993
World Economic Outlook.) Estimates of the output gap and of
the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus financial assets
corresponding to debt instruments.

Austria: IMF staff fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ latest medium-term plans, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff ’s macroeconomic assumptions and assuming some moderate expenditure
restraint over the medium term in line with historical patterns.
Belgium: Projections are based on the 2024 Budgetary Plan, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections are based on the authorities’ budget proposal, fiscal measures announced by
the authorities, and staff estimates and assumptions.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
from the Government of Canada’s Budget 2024,
the one-time disbursement for the compensation
and agreement-in-principle for long-term reform of
First Nations Child and Family Services and Jordan’s
Principle, and the latest provincial budget updates.
Chile: Fiscal projections are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff ’s macroeconomic projections.
China: IMF staff fiscal projections incorporate
the 2024 budget as well as estimates of off-budget
financing.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are
aligned with the latest official budget numbers,
adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff ’s
macroeconomic assumptions. Beyond the current
year, the projections incorporate key features of
the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ latest budget. Structural balances are
net of temporary fluctuations in some revenues
(for example, North Sea revenue, pension yield tax
revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19–related one-offs
are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2024 onward are based
on the country’s 2018–24 budget laws, Stability
Programme 2024–27, draft medium-term programming bill, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences in
revenue projections and assumptions on macroeconomic and financial variables.
Germany: Projections are based on the latest
approved federal budget, draft federal budget
(if applicable), EU Stability Programme, and

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

medium-term budget plan. They also take into
account data updates from the federal statistical
office (Destatis) and the Ministry of Finance.
Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in
line with the primary balance definition under the
enhanced surveillance framework for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Projections are based on the authorities’ medium-term
fiscal projections for expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF
staff ’s projections for the macroeconomic framework and fiscal policy plans announced in the 2024
budgets.
India: Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions. Subnational
data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year;
general government data are thus finalized well
after central government data. IMF and Indian
presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds, net versus gross
recording of revenues in certain minor categories,
and some public sector lending. Starting with
FY2020/21 data, expenditure also includes the
off-budget component of food subsidies, consistent
with the revised treatment of food subsidies in the
budget. The IMF staff adjusts expenditure to take
out payments for previous years’ food subsidies,
which are included as expenditure in budget estimates for FY2020/21.
Indonesia: The IMF staff ’s projections are based
on the latest budget, extrapolating using projected
nominal GDP (and its components as needed) with
application of judgment to reflect the authorities’
spending and revenue policies over the medium
term.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2024.
Israel: Projections for Israel are subject to significant risks given the unpredictability of the impact
of the conflict in the region. Fiscal projections are
based on the assumption that in the short-term
higher government spending is used to support
the economy and cover military costs, but after
2024 fiscal measures are expected to help contain
the fiscal deficit. The general government balance

108

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

is projected based on the 2024 state budget and
partial information on the other components.
Italy: The IMF staff ’s estimates and projections
are informed by the fiscal plans included in the
government’s 2024 Economic and Financial Document (DEF). All historical national accounts data
and projections reflect the official published series,
updated as of October 4, 2024.
Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the
government has already announced, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates the latest annual
budget, any supplementary budget, any proposed
new budget and medium-term fiscal plan, and IMF
staff estimates.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing
requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for
some statistical discrepancies between above-the-line
and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for
2024 are informed by the estimates in Pre-Criterios
2025; projections for 2024 onward assume continued compliance with rules established in the Federal
Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2024–29
are based on the IMF staff ’s forecast framework
and are also informed by the authorities’ 2024
budget, the 2024 Spring Memorandum, the new
government’s coalition agreement, and Bureau for
Economic Policy Analysis projections.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
FY2023/24 Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff ’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption
of unchanged policies. Projections for 2024 reflect
information available in the 2024 budget proposal.
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by
the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, which was prepared in October 2023,
certified by the Financial Oversight and Management Board.
Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended in March
2022 by the government in response to the
sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine,
allowing for windfall oil and gas revenues above

benchmark to be used to finance a larger deficit in
2022 as well as savings accumulated in the National
Welfare Fund. The 2023–25 budget was based on
a modified rule with a two-year transition period
which set the benchmark oil and gas revenues
fixed in rubles at Rub 8 trillion, compared with a
fixed benchmark oil price at $40 a barrel under the
2019 fiscal rule. However, in late-September 2023,
the Ministry of Finance proposed reverting to the
earlier version of the fiscal rule from 2024 onward
to determine the price of oil and gas revenues but
set the benchmark oil price at $60 a barrel. The
new rule allows for higher oil and gas revenues to
be spent, but it simultaneously targets a smaller
primary structural deficit.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff ’s baseline fiscal
projections are based primarily on its understanding of government policies as outlined in the
2024 budget and recent official announcements.
Export oil revenues are based on WEO baseline
oil price assumptions and the IMF staff ’s understanding of oil production adjustments under the
OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC
oil exporters) agreement and those unilaterally
announced by Saudi Arabia.
Singapore: FY2023 projections are based on
revised figures based on budget execution through
the end of 2023. FY2024 projections are based on
the initial budget of February 16, 2024. IMF staff
projections include (1) an increase in the goods
and services tax from 8 percent to 9 percent on
January 1, 2024; and (2) an increase in the carbon
tax from S$5 a tonne to S$25 a tonne in 2024 and
2025 and S$45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are informed
by the 2024 budget. Nontax revenue excludes
transactions in financial assets and liabilities, as
they involve primarily revenues associated with
the realized exchange rate valuation gains from the
holding of foreign currency deposits, sale of assets,
and conceptually similar items. The Eskom debt
relief is treated as a capital transfer above-the-line
item.
Spain: Fiscal numbers for 2023 include energy
support measures amounting to 1 percent of GDP,

which are phased out throughout 2024. Forecasts
reflect grants and loans under the EU Recovery and
Resilience Facility disbursed over 2023–27.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff ’s macroeconomic forecasts. Cyclical adjustment
on the fiscal accounts is calculated by accounting
for output gap.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s
fiscal rules.
Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the
IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some
revenue and expenditure items that are included in
the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based
on the March 2024 forecast from the Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the January 2024
release on public sector finances from the Office
for National Statistics. The IMF staff ’s projections
take the OBR forecast as a reference and overlay
adjustments (for differences in assumptions) to both
revenues and expenditures. The IMF staff ’s forecasts do not necessarily assume that the fiscal rules
announced on November 17, 2022, will be met at
the end of the forecast period. Data are presented
on a calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
June 2024 Congressional Budget Office baseline
and the latest treasury monthly statement, adjusted
for the IMF staff ’s policy and macroeconomic
assumptions. Projections incorporate the effects of
the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each economy. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that
inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range;
they will decrease when indicators suggest inflation
will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that
output growth is below its potential rate, and that
the margin of slack in the economy is significant.

responsive to incoming data, while taking
into account international monetary policy
developments.
Türkiye: The baseline assumes that the monetary
policy stance will remain in line with announced

United Kingdom: Monetary policy assumptions
for the UK are based on the IMF staff ’s assessment of the most likely path for interest rates,
considering the broader macroeconomic outlook,
model results, the Bank of England’s inflation
forecasts and communications, and market
expectations.
United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal
Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the
federal funds target rate in line with the broader
macroeconomic outlook.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A2. Revised World Economic Outlook Purchasing-Power-Parity Weights
Comparing output, income, and other key
economic indicators across countries is essential
for analyzing global economic performance and
guiding policy decisions. To facilitate this comparison, one approach is to convert nominal values
from local currencies into a common currency,
such as the US dollar. However, this approach falls
short of recognizing differences in price levels across
countries: the same income, when expressed in US
dollars, will buy more goods and services in a country where prices are lower.
To adjust for differences in price levels across
countries, purchasing-power-parity exchange
rates (PPPs) are used. PPPs both convert different
currencies to a common currency and show, with
reference to a base economy (the United States),
the relative price of the same basket of goods and
services across countries. In the World Economic
Outlook, PPPs are used to convert nominal GDP
expressed in local currency to PPP-based GDP, thus
enabling comparison of economic output across
countries.1 PPP GDP is further used as weights
when computing regional and global real GDP
growth rates and other real sector aggregates. The
same weights are also used to derive regional and
global inflation measures.
PPPs are sourced from the International Comparison Program (ICP), maintained and published
by the World Bank in coordination with other
international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund. In May 2024, new PPPs
were released for the 2021 reference year. Revised
results for the preceding reference year, 2017, and
estimates of annual PPPs for 2018–20 were also
released. In the October 2024 World Economic
Outlook, following the standard methodology, PPPs
are derived by taking the new 2017–21 data and
extrapolating it to all preceding and subsequent
years using growth rates in relative GDP deflators
(the GDP deflator of a country divided by the
GDP deflator of the United States).
The author of this box is Evgenia Weaver.
1PPPGDP=NGDP/PPPEX, where NGDP is nominal GDP in
local currency and PPPEX is the purchasing-power-parity (PPP)
exchange rate. See World Economic Outlook frequently asked
questions for more information on the use of PPPs. https://www.
imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/frequently-asked-questions.

This PPP data update leads to revisions in PPP
GDP weights and to revisions in regional and global
aggregates, as outlined in more detail below. Overall, the magnitude of the revisions resulting from
the new ICP release was smaller compared with the
previous ICP release (see, for example, Box 1.1 of the
October 2020 World Economic Outlook).
PPP Weight Changes for Regions and Economies
Based on the results of the new ICP release
extrapolated to 2024, price levels are estimated to
be lower for most countries compared with the
extrapolated data based on the previous ICP release.
As a result, PPP-based GDP is estimated to be
higher for both advanced economies and emerging
market and developing economies.
However, in relative terms, the increase in PPP
GDP experienced by emerging market and developing economies was bigger than that experienced by
advanced economies. For this reason, the share of
advanced economies in world GDP decreased from
40.9 percent, based on the previous PPP measures
(Table A2.1, column 3), to 40.2 percent, based on
new PPPs (column 6) in 2024. This corresponds to a
0.7 percentage point decline for the advanced economies (column 7). The share of emerging market
and developing economies increased from 59.1 to
59.8 percent, a mirror 0.7 percentage point increase.2
The revisions for advanced economies are driven
mostly by the decline in the US share. Among
emerging market and developing economies, Russia
and India drove most of the upward revision. But
not all emerging market and developing economy regions experienced an upward revision. The
Middle East and Central Asia share of world GDP
decreased by 0.3 percentage point in 2024.
Impact of PPP Revision on Aggregate Growth
Given the relatively small changes in world GDP
shares, the impact of the new weights on world and
2The PPP-based share of world GDP for emerging market
and developing economies is in general higher than the market
exchange rate share of 41.2 percent (column 8), whereas for
advanced economies it is lower than the market exchange rate
share of 58.8 percent, reflecting the role of PPPs in accounting
for price level differences between advanced economies and
emerging market and developing economies.

regional aggregates is negligible. Table A2.2 shows
aggregate real GDP growth rates for 2023–25
derived using previous and new weights. The
differences are small (columns 7–9), not exceeding

0.1 percentage point in either direction, and are
driven by changes in weights for some of the
slower-, or conversely faster-, growing economies
within those economy groups.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’
national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of
payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to
the current account balance (CAB) (S – I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1 Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
OCTOBER 2024

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on October 8, 2024.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with staff ’s
assessment of the global economic outlook,
risks, and policy priorities. They welcomed
the continued growth resilience of the global
economy in the face of recurring shocks. Directors
highlighted that monetary policy has managed to bring
about disinflation with so‑far limited cost to output
and employment, increasing the likelihood of a smooth
landing. They noted, however, that the recovery
remains uneven and that growth, while steady, remains
underwhelming, reflecting weak productivity growth.
They noted that mediocre medium‑term growth and
rising debt trajectories increase the risk that the global
economy will become entrenched in a low-growth,
high-debt environment. Against this backdrop, they
agreed that, as monetary policy becomes less restrictive,
a renewed emphasis on gradual and sustained fiscal
consolidation, coupled with ambitious structural
reforms, is needed, with due regard for country‑specific
conditions.
While most Directors agreed that risks to the
outlook are now tilted to the downside, a number
of Directors also cautioned against overstating the
deterioration in the balance of risks. Directors
noted, in particular, risks from potentially more
persistent underlying inflation, increased geopolitical
conflicts and tensions in different regions, and the
intensification of protectionist policies that could
weigh down on medium-term growth. Directors
noted that while the monetary easing underway has
helped keep financial conditions accommodative and
near-term financial stability risks at bay, this may in
turn facilitate the buildup of financial vulnerabilities.
They stressed that the widening disconnect between
subdued financial market volatility, relative to elevated
economic and geopolitical uncertainty, increases the
chances of sharp disorderly repricing. Further volatility
surges could impair financial stability as well as

investment and growth, especially in emerging market
and developing economies heavily reliant on external
financing. Directors also noted still-acute pressures on
commercial real estate sectors and ongoing property
sector adjustments in some countries. Some Directors
highlighted upside risks to the outlook, including
a stronger recovery in investment in advanced
economies, better performance in some emerging
market economies, and economic benefits from
artificial intelligence.
Directors called on central banks to carefully
calibrate monetary policy to restore price stability,
avoiding a tighter-than-necessary stance that could
weaken growth and employment. They emphasized
the importance of remaining data dependent and
clearly communicating policy decisions. Directors
stressed that, in economies where core inflation persists
at above-target levels, policy rates should remain in
restrictive territory until underlying inflation shows
clear signs of moving toward target. They agreed that
moving to a more neutral stance is appropriate in
economies where inflation is unambiguously abating,
long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, and
output gaps are closing. Given elevated economic and
policy uncertainty, Directors called on central banks
to stand ready to mitigate the potential disruptive
impacts of foreign exchange volatility and capital
flows, including by leveraging, where appropriate,
the country-specific guidance provided by the IMF’s
Integrated Policy Framework.
Directors welcomed that the global banking sector
has remained resilient and emphasized that further
progress on adopting and implementing frameworks for
recovery and resolution is critical for addressing weak
or failing banks. They concurred that full, timely, and
consistent implementation of international standards,
including Basel III, remains important to enhance
prudential frameworks. Directors stressed the need

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

155

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: POLIC Y PIVOT, RISING THREATS

to improve non-bank financial institutions’ liquidity
preparedness, implement the Financial Stability Board’s
agreed-upon standards, close data gaps, and enhance
stress testing for non-banks to reduce systemic risks.
Directors generally called for sustained, gradual,
and carefully designed fiscal adjustments amid
elevated public debt and associated risks. They noted
that larger adjustments than currently envisaged
in many countries are needed to stabilize debt
and build necessary buffers against adverse shocks.
Directors stressed that the pace of adjustment
should be calibrated to country-specific economic
conditions, should ensure continuous support to
the most vulnerable and protect public investment,
and should be well communicated and anchored in
credible medium-term frameworks. They stressed
that strengthening fiscal governance should be a
priority and would help reduce the debt buildup from
contingent liabilities and arrears.

156

International Monetary Fund | October 2024

Directors stressed the importance of advancing
structural reforms to boost growth and accelerate
the green transition, noting the need to enhance the
social acceptability of these reforms through enhanced
communication and trust-building mechanisms.
They emphasized that targeted reforms are needed
to boost productivity, enhance competition, improve
human capital, and increase labor force participation.
Directors reiterated the need to advance with climate
mitigation and adaptation reforms. In this context,
some Directors emphasized the need to strengthen
efforts to increase climate finance for adaptation,
especially for vulnerable countries exposed to
significant climate risks.
Directors underscored that stronger multilateral
cooperation is essential to facilitate debt restructuring
processes, mitigate risks from geoeconomic
fragmentation, and accelerate the green transition in a
manner consistent with World Trade Organization rules.
