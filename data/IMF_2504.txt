ASSUMPTIONS AND CONVENTIONS

A number of assumptions have been adopted for the projections presented in the World Economic Outlook
(WEO). It has been assumed that real effective exchange rates remained constant at their average levels during
March 6, 2025–April 3, 2025, except for those for the currencies participating in the European exchange rate
mechanism II, which are assumed to have remained constant in nominal terms relative to the euro; that established policies of national authorities will be maintained (for specific assumptions about fiscal and monetary policies for selected economies, see Box A1 in the Statistical Appendix); that the average price of oil will be $66.94
a barrel in 2025 and $62.38 a barrel in 2026; that the three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2026, that for the euro area will average 2.2 percent in 2025
and 2.1 percent in 2026, and that for Japan will average 0.5 percent in 2025 and 0.8 percent in 2026; and that
the 10-year government bond yield for the United States will average 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.8 percent in
2026, that for the euro area will average 2.6 percent in 2025 and 2.7 percent in 2026, and that for Japan will
average 1.4 percent in 2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026. These are, of course, working hypotheses rather than forecasts, and the uncertainties surrounding them add to the margin of error that would, in any event, be involved
in the projections. The estimates and projections are based on statistical information available through April 14,
2025, but may not reflect the latest published data in all cases. For the date of the last data update for each economy, please refer to the notes provided in the online WEO database. Some economies have revised projections
based on developments in commodity markets and international trade as of April 4, 2025; these economies are
listed in Box A2 in the Statistical Appendix.
The following conventions are used throughout the WEO:
• . . . to indicate that data are not available or not applicable;
• – between years or months (for example, 2023–24 or January–June) to indicate the years or months covered,
including the beginning and ending years or months; and
• / between years or months (for example, 2023/24) to indicate a fiscal or financial year.
• “Billion” means a thousand million; “trillion” means a thousand billion.
• “Basis points” refers to hundredths of 1 percentage point (for example, 25 basis points are equivalent to ¼ of
1 percentage point).
• Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of a few countries that use fiscal years. Please refer to Table F in
the Statistical Appendix, which lists the economies with exceptional reporting periods for national accounts and
government finance data.
• For some countries, the figures for 2024 and earlier are based on estimates rather than actual outturns. Please
refer to Table G in the Statistical Appendix, which lists the latest actual outturns for the indicators in the
national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each country.
What is new in this publication:
• For Bolivia, projections for 2027–30 have been omitted because of significant uncertainty regarding the
economic outlook.
• For Ecuador, fiscal projections for 2025–30 are excluded from publication because of ongoing program
discussions.
In the tables and figures, the following conventions apply:
• Tables and figures in this report that list their source as “IMF staff calculations” or “IMF staff estimates” draw
on data from the WEO database.
• When countries are not listed alphabetically, they are ordered on the basis of economic size.

• Minor discrepancies between sums of constituent figures and totals shown reflect rounding.
• Composite data are provided for various groups of countries organized according to economic characteristics or
region. Unless noted otherwise, country group composites represent calculations based on 90 percent or more of
the weighted group data.
• The boundaries, colors, denominations, and any other information shown on maps do not imply, on the part of
the IMF, any judgment on the legal status of any territory or any endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries.
As used in this report, the terms “country” and “economy” do not in all cases refer to a territorial entity that is
a state as understood by international law and practice. As used here, the term also covers some territorial entities
that are not states but for which statistical data are maintained on a separate and independent basis.

PREFACE

The analysis and projections contained in the World Economic Outlook are integral elements of the IMF’s
surveillance of economic developments and policies in its member countries, of developments in international
financial markets, and of the global economic system. The survey of prospects and policies is the product of a
comprehensive interdepartmental review of world economic developments, which draws primarily on information
the IMF staff gathers through its consultations with member countries. These consultations are carried out
in particular by the IMF’s area departments—namely, the African Department, Asia and Pacific Department,
European Department, Middle East and Central Asia Department, and Western Hemisphere Department—
together with the Strategy, Policy, and Review Department; the Monetary and Capital Markets Department; and
the Fiscal Affairs Department.
The analysis in this report was coordinated in the Research Department under the general direction of
Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research. The project was directed by Petya
Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director, Research Department, and Deniz Igan, Division Chief, Research Department.
Aqib Aslam, Division Chief, Research Department and Head of the Spillovers Task Force, supervised Chapter 3.

FOREWORD

This April 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO)
was put together under exceptional circumstances,
and I want to start by acknowledging the tremendous
work of Petya Koeva Brooks, Deputy Director in the
Research Department, and her team, as well as the staff
of over 190 country teams within the IMF who worked
tirelessly with us to revise their country projections
until the very last minute. The April 2 Rose Garden
announcement forced us to jettison our projections—
nearly finalized at that point—and compress a production cycle that usually takes more than two months into
less than 10 days.
Shortly after the January 2025 WEO Update, the
United States announced multiple waves of tariffs on
major trading partners and critical sectors, culminating
on April 2 with a set of nearly universal tariffs. While
many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for
now, the combination of measures and countermeasures
has hiked US and global tariff rates to centennial highs.
However, the context for such increases is very different.
Unlike in the previous century, the global economy is
now characterized by a high degree of economic and
financial integration, with supply chains and financial
flows crisscrossing the world, whose potential unwinding
could constitute a major source of economic upheaval.
For this reason, we expect that the sharp increase
on April 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to
a significant slowdown in global growth in the near
term. While this is our central scenario—or “reference
forecast”—many possible paths exist, reflecting the
unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the
varied impact of tariffs across different countries through
a diverse set of channels. These are discussed in detail in
Chapter 1.
The common denominator, however, is that tariffs
are a negative supply shock for the economy imposing
them, as resources are reallocated toward the production
of noncompetitive goods, with a resulting loss of aggregate productivity, lower activity, and higher production
costs and prices. Moreover, in the medium term, by
reducing competition, tariffs increase the market power
of domestic producers, decrease incentives to innovate,

xii

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

and create multiple opportunities for rent seeking. For
trading partners, tariffs constitute mostly a negative
external demand shock, driving foreign customers away
from their products, even if some countries could benefit from the rerouting of trade flows.
These effects are magnified in the presence of modern
complex global supply chains. Most traded goods are
intermediate inputs that traverse countries multiple
times before their transformation into final products.
Sectoral disruptions could propagate up and down
the global input-output network in ways with potentially large multiplier effects, just as we saw during the
pandemic. Anticipating such disruptions we have also
revised down our projection for global trade growth by
1½ percentage points this year, with a slight recovery
penciled in for 2026.
The uncertainty around trade policy is also a major
factor depressing our outlook. Faced with increased
uncertainty about access to markets—their own but also
those of their suppliers and customers—many firms’ initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment, and cut
purchases. Likewise, financial institutions will reevaluate
their credit supply to businesses, until they can assess the
latter’s exposure to the new environment. The combined increased uncertainty and resulting tightening of
financial conditions are a global negative demand shock
and will weigh on activity. This could well dominate in
the short term—as reflected in the sharp decline in oil
prices.
The effect of tariffs on exchange rates is not straightforward. First, the US, as the tariffing economy, may
see its currency appreciate, as happened in previous
episodes. This reflects the reduced demand for foreign
currency as the demand for imports declines, but also
the likelihood that tariffed countries may ease their
monetary policy stance to respond to the negative
demand shock. However, greater policy uncertainty,
lower growth prospects in the US, and an adjustment
in the global demand for dollar assets—which has been
orderly so far—can weigh on the dollar, as we saw in
the immediate aftermath of the announcements. In the
medium term, the dollar may depreciate in real terms if

FOREWORD

tariffs translate into lower productivity in the US tradables sector, relative to its trading partners.
At this juncture, while the situation remains fluid,
risks remain firmly tilted to the downside. The global
economy showed surprising resilience during the severe
shocks of the past four years and still bears significant
scars. It is now being severely tested once again, especially in emerging market and developing economies
with more limited buffers. More immediately, there is
a risk that trade retaliation may further ratchet up—
instead of dialing down—trade tensions, with negative
consequences for global growth. Financial conditions
may further tighten—perhaps abruptly—if markets react
negatively to diminished growth prospects and increased
uncertainty. While banks remain well capitalized overall,
and market movements have been orderly so far, they
may be tested in the case of a full-blown risk-off episode. The April 2025 Global Financial Stability Report
reviews these market developments in detail. Yet herein
lies also an upside: If countries deescalate from their
current tariff stance, and coordinate to deliver clarity
and stability on trade policy, the outlook could immediately brighten.
Our policy prescriptions call for prudence, clarity,
and increased collaboration. First, on trade policy the
message is clear: to bring back stability and find mutually beneficial trade arrangements. It is not clear yet
what new architecture will emerge. But businesses need
predictability going forward. And the global economy
needs a well-functioning rules-based trading system that
addresses long-standing gaps, such as the pervasive use
of nontariff barriers and trade-distorting measures by
some countries.
Second, monetary policy will need to remain ahead
of the curve in the face of multiple challenges. Faced
with tariffs and supply-chain disruptions, some countries may confront steeper trade-offs between inflation
and output. Inflation expectations may become less well
anchored with a new inflation shock following so close
on the heels of the previous one. For these countries,
forceful tightening will be needed. For others, the negative demand shock will dominate, and their economies
may slump unless policy rates are lowered. In all cases,
credibility of the monetary policy framework—and its
cornerstone, central bank independence—will remain
key.
Third, currency markets may experience strong
volatility. This may be difficult to navigate, especially for

emerging market economies. In line with our Integrated
Policy Framework, it is important that countries let
their currency adjust when the movements are driven
by fundamental policy forces, as is the case now. That
framework spells out the specific conditions under
which it could be advisable for countries to intervene in
currency markets.
Fourth, fiscal authorities face starker trade-offs on top
of preexisting vulnerabilities associated with high debt,
low growth, and rising financing costs. Heightened pressure on bond yields amid growing market nervousness
could threaten fiscal stability. In addition, new spending pressures are further weighing on fiscal fragilities.
Calls for support will increase for those at risk of severe
dislocation from trade policy. Some support may be
inevitable—and even desirable—but should remain
narrowly targeted and incorporate automatic sunset
clauses. The experience of the past four years suggests
that it is easier to open the tap of fiscal support than to
close it. Sunset clauses should also help frame expectations. Moreover, some countries, especially in Europe,
face new and permanent increases in defense-related
spending.
How should these new outlays be financed? For
countries with little fiscal space, the answer is stark
but simple: They have little choice but to stay within
their budgetary envelope. Doing otherwise would
jeopardize medium-term debt sustainability, with dire
consequences. For countries with sufficient fiscal space,
standard fiscal principles suggest that only the temporary part of the additional spending—for example,
temporary support to help adapt to the new environment or an initial bulge in spending to rebuild defense
capabilities—should be financed by debt. New permanent spending needs should be offset by spending cuts
elsewhere or stronger domestic revenue mobilization.
These points are further developed in the April 2025
Fiscal Monitor.
Fifth, we need to continue efforts to turn the tide
on weak medium-term growth prospects. This means
boosting total factor productivity, which can be raised
by addressing existing deep-seated structural constraints
that are holding back innovation, but also by exploiting
technological breakthroughs. The recent progress of
generative artificial intelligence offers such a promise,
and countries should position themselves to harness it
responsibly. This can be done by implementing policies to develop the necessary digital infrastructure and

acquire the skills necessary to benefit from the artificial
intelligence transition.
In this direction, the analytical chapters of our report
take a step back and explore how the nexus of labor
supply and growth plays out over the medium term.
They tackle interrelated themes of asynchronous aging
and migration. Chapter 2—“The Rise of the Silver
Economy”—focuses on the challenges from demographic headwinds for growth and public finances
and shows that progress in “healthy aging”—people
living not only longer, but living healthier—has been
substantial. This, together with policies that help
increase labor force participation and close gender gaps,

xiv

can offset some of the negative effects of aging populations. Chapter 3—“Journeys and Junctions”—focuses
on the spillover from migration policies in destination
countries to origin, transit, and bordering economies. It
highlights that emerging market and developing economies are increasingly on the receiving end of migration
and refugee flows and that policies to improve the
integration of migrants, minimizing skills mismatches,
and alleviate pressures on local infrastructure can have
large effects.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following an unprecedented series of shocks in
the preceding years, global growth was stable yet
underwhelming through 2024 and was projected to
remain so in the January 2025 World Economic Outlook
(WEO) Update. However, the landscape has changed
as governments around the world reorder policy
priorities. Since the release of the January 2025 WEO
Update, a series of new tariff measures by the United
States and countermeasures by its trading partners
have been announced and implemented, ending up
in near-universal US tariffs on April 2 and bringing
effective tariff rates to levels not seen in a century
(Figure ES.1). This on its own is a major negative
shock to growth. The unpredictability with which
these measures have been unfolding also has a negative
impact on economic activity and the outlook and, at
the same time, makes it more difficult than usual to
make assumptions that would constitute a basis for an
internally consistent and timely set of projections.
Given the complexity and fluidity of the current
moment, this report presents a “reference forecast”
based on information available as of April 4, 2025
(including the April 2 tariffs and initial responses), in
lieu of the usual baseline. This is complemented with
a range of global growth forecasts, primarily under
different trade policy assumptions.
The swift escalation of trade tensions and extremely
high levels of policy uncertainty are expected to have a
significant impact on global economic activity. Under
the reference forecast that incorporates information
as of April 4, global growth is projected to drop to
2.8 percent in 2025 and 3 percent in 2026—down
from 3.3 percent for both years in the January 2025
WEO Update, corresponding to a cumulative downgrade of 0.8 percentage point, and much below the
historical (2000–19) average of 3.7 percent.
In the reference forecast, growth in advanced economies is projected to be 1.4 percent in 2025. Growth
in the United States is expected to slow to 1.8 percent,
a pace that is 0.9 percentage point lower relative to
the projection in the January 2025 WEO Update, on
account of greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions,
and softer demand momentum, whereas growth in

Agreement (USMCA) carve-out is assumed to halve the effective tariff increase for
Canada and Mexico. The April 2 tariffs include auto sector tariffs and country-specific

the euro area at 0.8 percent is expected to slow by
0.2 percentage point. In emerging market and developing economies, growth is expected to slow down
to 3.7 percent in 2025 and 3.9 percent in 2026, with
significant downgrades for countries affected most by
recent trade measures, such as China. Global headline
inflation is expected to decline at a pace that is slightly
slower than what was expected in January, reaching
4.3 percent in 2025 and 3.6 percent in 2026, with
notable upward revisions for advanced economies and
slight downward revisions for emerging market and
developing economies in 2025.
Intensifying downside risks dominate the outlook.
Ratcheting up a trade war, along with even more
elevated trade policy uncertainty, could further reduce

buffers weaken resilience to future shocks. Divergent
and rapidly shifting policy stances or deteriorating
sentiment could trigger additional repricing of assets
beyond what took place after the announcement of
sweeping US tariffs on April 2 and sharp adjustments
in foreign exchange rates and capital flows, especially
for economies already facing debt distress. Broader
financial instability may ensue, including damage to
the international monetary system. Demographic shifts
and a shrinking foreign labor force may curb potential
growth and threaten fiscal sustainability. The lingering
effects of the recent cost-of-living crisis, coupled with
depleted policy space and dim medium-term growth
prospects, could reignite social unrest. The resilience
shown by many large emerging market economies may
be tested as servicing high debt levels becomes more
challenging in unfavorable global financial conditions.
More limited international development assistance may
increase the pressure on low-income countries, pushing
them deeper into debt or necessitating significant fiscal
adjustments, with immediate consequences for growth
and living standards. On the upside, a deescalation
from current tariff rates and new agreements providing
clarity and stability in trade policies could lift global
growth.
The path forward demands clarity and coordination.
Countries should work constructively to promote a
stable and predictable trade environment, facilitate
debt restructuring, and address shared challenges. At

xvi

the same time, they should address domestic policy
and structural imbalances, thereby ensuring their
internal economic stability. This will help rebalance
growth-inflation trade-offs, rebuild buffers, and
reinvigorate medium-term growth prospects, as well
as reduce global imbalances. The priority for central
banks remains fine-tuning monetary policy stances to
achieve their mandates and ensure price and financial
stability in an environment with even more difficult
trade-offs. Mitigating disruptive foreign exchange
volatility may require targeted interventions, as
outlined in the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework.
Macroprudential tools should be activated as needed to
contain the buildup of vulnerabilities and to provide
support in case of stress events. Restoring fiscal space
and putting public debt on a sustainable path remain
an important priority, while meeting critical spending needs to ensure national and economic security.
This requires credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans. Structural reforms in labor, product, and
financial markets would complement efforts to reduce
debt and narrow cross-country disparities. As Chapter 2 explains, countries’ age structures are evolving
at different rates, with important consequences for
medium-term growth and external imbalances. In
addition, as Chapter 3 documents, migration policy
shifts in destination countries have sizable spillover
effects, disproportionately affecting emerging market
and developing economies.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Policy Uncertainty Tests Global Resilience
The global economy is at a critical juncture. Signs
of stabilization were emerging through much of 2024,
after a prolonged and challenging period of unprecedented shocks. Inflation, down from multidecade
highs, followed a gradual though bumpy decline
toward central bank targets (Figure 1.1). Labor markets
normalized, with unemployment and vacancy rates
returning to prepandemic levels (Figure 1.2). Growth
hovered around 3 percent in the past few years, and
global output came close to potential (Figure 1.3).
However, major policy shifts are resetting the global
trade system and giving rise to uncertainty that is
once again testing the resilience of the global economy. Since February, the United States has announced
multiple waves of tariffs against trading partners, some
of which have invoked countermeasures. Markets first
took the announcements mostly in stride, until the
United States’ near-universal application of tariffs on
April 2, which triggered historic drops in major equity
indices and spikes in bond yields, followed by a partial
recovery after the pause and additional carve-outs
announced on and after April 9. Despite significant
equity market corrections in early March and April,
price-to-earnings ratios in the United States remain at
elevated levels in historical context, raising concerns
about the potential for further disorderly corrections
(April 2025 Global Financial Stability Report [GFSR]).
Uncertainty, especially that regarding trade policy,
has surged to unprecedented levels (Figure 1.4). The
degree of the surge varies across countries, depending
on exposures to protectionist measures through trade
and financial linkages as well as broader geopolitical
relationships.
These developments come against an already-cooling economic momentum. Recent data on real
activity have been disappointing, with GDP growth
in the fourth quarter of 2024 trailing the forecasts in
the January 2025 World Economic Outlook (WEO)
Update. High-frequency indicators such as retail sales
and purchasing managers’ surveys point to slowing
growth. In the United States, consumer, business, and
investor sentiment was optimistic at the beginning

of the year but has recently shifted to a notably more
pessimistic stance as uncertainty has taken hold and
new tariffs have been announced. In labor markets,
hiring has slowed in many countries, and layoffs have
risen. Meanwhile, progress on disinflation has mostly
stalled, and inflation has edged upward in some cases,
with an increasing number of countries exceeding
their inflation targets. Services inflation, though still
on a downward trend, remains above levels prior to
the inflation surge, and core goods inflation has seen
an uptick since November 2024. Trade has held up,
but this is mostly because of an increase in Chinese
exports and US imports at the end of 2024, with
consumers and businesses likely front-loading ahead
of tariffs that were anticipated back then and now are
in place.
In the backdrop, domestic imbalances and policy
gaps give rise to unbalanced growth while opening up
potential fragilities. In some countries, such as China,
growth in 2024 has been mainly supported by external
demand. On the contrary, in the United States, private
consumption—traditionally the major contributor
to GDP growth—as a share of GDP has reached its
highest point during the 2020s, and the fiscal deficit
remains historically large. Within-country inequalities
in households’ income gains signal another potential
vulnerability. In some cases, real GDP has recovered,
but real GDP per capita has not (Figure 1.5, panel 1).
In others, median income has fallen behind, whereas
incomes at the top and bottom of the distribution have
recovered. Meanwhile, salient indicators of the cost of
living, such as house prices and rents, have increased
substantially (Figure 1.5, panel 2).

Varying Momentum across Countries
The stable performance of the global economy in
the past couple of years hides important differences
across countries. These differences are the result of
diverse shocks, structural characteristics, and policy
actions. They manifest themselves in varying cyclical positions and structural forces determining the
outlook.

Cyclical Positions
Most countries are not fully back to their inflation targets yet, but output gaps are more dispersed
(Figure 1.6, panel 1). In quite a few cases, fiscal policy
remains accommodative even as monetary policy maintains a restrictive stance (Figure 1.6, panel 2).
The US economy was operating above its potential in 2024, relying heavily on strong domestic
demand. Private consumption grew at an annual rate
of 2.8 percent in 2024, in excess of its 2.4 percent
historical (2000–19) average. However, in 2025, signs
of a potential reversal have emerged. Consumer spending declined by 0.6 percent in January and remained
subdued in February after expanding by 0.6 percent
in December 2024, with the decrease likely reflecting

The euro area has been in a cyclical rebound, but
domestic demand has been subdued and, with the
exception of Germany, the contribution of consumption growth may have peaked in its largest economies.

contributing to divergence among European countries,
particularly those relying more heavily on these sectors,
notably Germany versus Spain.
For China, prolonged weakness in the real estate
sector and its ramifications, including those for
local government finances, have been key. When the
pandemic seized the Chinese economy, signs of a
downturn in the credit-fueled property market were
gathering. This homegrown vulnerability has depressed
domestic demand, even as policymakers have searched
for measures to tackle property market oversupply and
bolster confidence. Indeed, consumer confidence in
China, after a decade of moving closely with that in
the rest of the world, plunged in early 2022 and has
not recovered (Figure 1.7). Rising trade tensions and
new tariffs over the past years have also disproportionately affected the Chinese economy. The rebalancing of
growth drivers from investment and net exports toward
consumption has paused amid continuing deflationary

pressures and high household saving. Construction and
real estate activity remains subdued, whereas industry,
trade, and transport have been robust.
Structural Forces
The varying momentum also owes to the interaction
of cyclical and structural factors. The cross-country
differences in growth rates would be expected to
narrow as the cyclical forces dissipate but may not
disappear.
Compared with the GDP level implied by the
prepandemic trend, most economies have made
up for some of the damage done by the pandemic
(Figure 1.8). The United States has been an outlier,
but generally, scarring has been less pronounced than
initially thought, speaking to the surprising resilience

of the global economy (April 2024 WEO). Still, there
are several cases in which output is still falling behind
the prepandemic trend.
A big part of the story behind the scarring is the
energy shock. European economies, including major
manufacturing hubs such as Germany and Italy, were
particularly exposed to the disruption of natural
gas markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
(Figure 1.9, panel 1). As oil and natural gas prices
soared, countries shifted their energy sources and
increased efficiency in their energy consumption.
There are limits to such strategies, however, because
substitution of energy sources may be difficult, and
many countries remain dependent on oil and natural
gas imports for their energy use (Figure 1.9, panels 2
and 3). Crucially, this shock had a twofold effect on
commodity importers as the dollar strengthened,
with the US terms of trade improving amid heightened uncertainty (External Stability Report 2024).
Because commodity prices are expressed in dollars,
the stagflationary pressures on commodity importers have become stronger. Similar dynamics apply to
global food markets, with the effects felt especially in
low-income countries. By contrast, the United States
not only was already less dependent on energy imports
but had also transitioned from being a net energy
importer to a net energy exporter. This shift has partly
insulated the US economy from the commodity market disruptions caused by the war.

Labor productivity growth has declined in recent
years in nearly every country besides the United States
(Figure 1.10, panel 1). The relative strength in US
labor productivity growth in part reflects stronger
investment (Figure 1.10, panel 2). Capital shallowing
because of chronic investment weakness can explain
roughly half of the productivity growth slowdown in
advanced economies since 2010 and about a third of
that in emerging market and developing economies
(Fernald and Li 2023; Igan and others 2024). Greater
labor market flexibility may have also played a role

have typically experienced slower productivity growth.

matches and prevent skill-diluting unemployment
spells, thereby enhancing medium-term productivity,
their effectiveness may be compromised by additional factors. The war-related energy shock, coupled
with the persistent nature of these disruptions, could
adversely affect productivity by obstructing the necessary reallocation of resources across different sectors of
the economy. More generally, traditionally higher job
market churn in the United States relative to that in
Europe has likely allowed workers to make job-to-job
transitions more easily.
The productivity growth discrepancies have a
counterpart in how manufacturing activity continues to shift away from advanced economies to
emerging market economies. Industrial production
plunged in all countries at the onset of the pandemic
(Figure 1.11). The recovery paths, however, have been
decisively different. Production has soared in China
and has also expanded in smaller EU economies and
the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand), whereas it has struggled to get
back to prepandemic levels in Japan and the largest EU

countries. Industrial production in the United States
has made it back up and performed better there than
in advanced economy peers.
Adding to the manufacturing headwinds in some
economies are demographic headwinds. Countries
around the world are progressively crossing their
demographic turning points—when the share of
the working-age population starts declining—with
direct implications for labor supply and productivity (see Chapter 2). Germany, Italy, and Japan are
ahead of others with declining shares of working-age
population, as is China, while the United States
is not too far behind those countries, but strong
flows of immigrants with quick adaptation to labor
markets have shielded its economy more than other
economies.

Diminished Policy Space
Crucially, much of the available policy space has
already been exhausted in many countries (April 2020,
April 2021, and October 2022 WEO reports), limiting how much support policymakers can give economies in case of new negative shocks or a pronounced
downturn. Many countries passed large fiscal support
packages, first during the pandemic and then as energy
and food prices spiked at the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fiscal policy was expected to pivot

CHAPTER 1

somewhat toward consolidation; however, on account
of recent geopolitical developments, some regions
are now poised to pursue fiscal expansion. After the
pandemic, the decisive and forceful monetary policy
response brought inflation down to near central bank
targets at relatively little cost to economic activity (see
Chapter 2 of the October 2024 WEO). The hardearned credibility of central banks played an important
role by limiting de-anchoring of inflation expectations.
But the legacies, in the form of high public debt
levels and increased scrutiny of central bank decisions,
remain.
High Public Debt amid Elevated Interest Rates
Fiscal support during the pandemic and at the onset
of the war in Ukraine in response to spiking energy
and food prices supported the recovery. But fiscal measures sharply increased debt-to-GDP ratios. Despite
some reductions that have occurred and additional cuts
being planned, budget deficits remain large and cast
a shadow on the outlook. Fiscal space is now much
tighter than a decade ago, and the fiscal adjustment
required to stabilize debt ratios is at a historic high
(Figure 1.12, panel 1).
At the same time, debt service as a fraction of
fiscal revenue is rising (Figure 1.12, panel 2). The
heterogeneous increase reflects cross-country divergence in fiscal policy stances, growth and inflation
patterns, and debt maturity structures, with relatively larger reliance on short-term debt in some
cases. Although servicing costs remain below pandemic levels in countries where debt was incurred
under favorable conditions during COVID-19,
effective rates are likely to surpass prepandemic levels as debt rolls over, notably those for low-income
countries and some emerging market and developing
economies.
After more than a decade of very low interest
rates in advanced economies, real long-term government bond yields have been on the rise (Figure 1.12,
panel 3), surging significantly in recent months.
Higher long-term rates, initially driven by monetary
policy tightening, are persisting even as the monetary
policy cycle has turned, owing to a global rise in term
premiums. In the United States, a combination of
increased issuances, higher expected inflation, and risk
premiums compounded the rise in term premiums
until mid-January, when long-term interest rates moderated. The recent tariff announcements pushed them
back up again.

target (Figure 1.13). Yields remain sensitive to inflation surprises and diminishing fiscal space (April 2025
GFSR). In economies already operating at or close to
potential and facing potential inflationary pressures,
including those from new trade policies and exchange
rate movements, there is less leeway for central banks
to “look through” new negative supply shocks.

Global Imbalances Arising from Domestic
Imbalances
Rising geopolitical tensions and widening domestic
imbalances—in particular, weak demand in China and
strong demand in the United States—have renewed
concerns about global imbalances (Gourinchas and
others 2024). Other nonmarket policies and state interventions could also contribute to external imbalances.
The volume of international trade in percent of
world GDP has been broadly stable, but structural
changes have been taking place nonetheless. Overall,

increasingly more trade has been occurring within
countries historically aligned with each other rather
than between them (October 2024 WEO). Moreover,
since 2016–17, China and the United States have
diversified their bases of trading partners, decoupling
from each other in terms of export and import linkages
(Figure 1.14). In some cases, this diversification has
happened at a microeconomic level along the supply
chain through trade rerouting and production reallocation, such as that which has taken place among
emerging markets in Asia, with an increasing share of
import origination for the United States and as import
as well as export counterparts for China. In addition, a
distinct macroeconomic dimension of trade reallocation
has emerged. For example, shifting demand patterns
have led Europe to import more from China in general,
and from the United States in the energy sector. At the
same time, Europe is exporting more to the United
States in other sectors. As a result, Europe’s trade exposure to both China and the United States has increased.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Imbalances are also becoming visible in net international investment positions. The net asset position
of US residents—US holdings of foreign securities
minus foreign holdings of US securities—resumed its
downward trend in 2023 after increasing briefly in
2022 (April 2025 GFSR). The decline is attributable
not only to US equity prices increasing more than foreign equity prices but also to rising foreign purchases
of US bonds during this period. Recent years have
also seen a concentration of foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows toward the United States (Figure 1.15,
panel 1).
The dollar appreciated sharply in the run-up to
the US elections in November 2024, with markets
expecting higher US growth and tighter monetary
policy. However, since February 2025, the dollar has
lost all the gains it achieved in the last quarter of 2024
(Figure 1.15, panel 2), on the back of weaker US
growth prospects and uncertainty. Initial depreciation
pressures were particularly pronounced for the currencies of emerging market and developing economies,
but they have dissipated following the softening in
2025 (Figure 1.15, panel 3). Since April 2, global risk
appetite has declined substantially, with the risk-off
environment inducing an offset to the appreciation of
emerging market currencies.

The Outlook: A Range of Possibilities

The swift escalation of trade tensions has generated
extremely high levels of policy ambiguity, making it
more difficult than usual to establish a central global
growth outlook. Therefore, this WEO presents a range
of global growth projections. First is a “reference forecast” based on measures announced as of April 4. This
is what is presented in the tables of this report and the
WEO database. Second, a pre–April 2 forecast (with a
cutoff date of late March) incorporates all prior policy
announcements and economic developments since the
October 2024 WEO. Third, a post–April 9 model-based
forecast is used to quantify the implications of the
announced pause and associated additional exemptions, as well as the escalating tariff rates between
China and the United States.

Global current account balances—the sums of absolute surpluses and deficits—have declined from their
2022 peaks. But they remain larger than the averages
observed just before the pandemic (see “The Outlook:
A Range of Possibilities” section). The deficit in the
United States is larger than it was in the late 2010s.

level of prevailing uncertainty, Box 1.1 presents scenarios involving additional trade, fiscal, and structural
policies as well as other plausible shocks.
• Commodity price projections: Prices of fuel commodities are projected to decrease in 2025 by
7.9 percent, with a 15.5 percent decline in oil prices
and a 15.8 percent drop in coal prices offset by a

10

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

22.8 percent increase in natural gas prices, the latter
driven up by colder-than-expected weather and the
halt of Russian gas flow to Europe through Ukraine
since January 1. Nonfuel commodity prices are projected to increase by 4.4 percent in 2025. Projected
food and beverage prices have been revised upward
compared with those in the January 2025 WEO
Update.
• Monetary policy projections: The Federal Reserve and
the European Central Bank are expected to continue to reduce interest rates in the coming quarters,
albeit at different paces from one another. In the
United States, the federal funds rate is projected to
be down to 4 percent at the end of 2025 and reach
its long-term equilibrium of 2.9 percent at the end
of 2028. In the euro area, 100 basis points in cuts
are expected in 2025 (with three cuts having already
occurred this year), representing two more 25 basis
point cuts than in the assumptions underlying
the October 2024 WEO, bringing the policy rate
to 2 percent by the middle of the year. In Japan,
policy rates are expected to be lifted at a similar
pace as assumed in October 2024, gradually rising
over the medium term toward a neutral setting of
about 1.5 percent, consistent with keeping inflation
and inflation expectations anchored at the Bank of
Japan’s 2 percent target.
• Fiscal policy projections: Governments in advanced
economies on average are expected to tighten
fiscal policy in 2025–26 and, to a lesser extent, in
2027. The general government structural-fiscal-balance-to-GDP ratio is expected to improve by 1
percentage point in the United States in 2025. Yet
it is worth noting that under current policies, US
public debt fails to stabilize, rising from 121 percent
of GDP in 2024 to 130 percent of GDP in 2030.
These projections do not incorporate measures that
remain under discussion at the time of publication,
notably, the net expansionary US budget resolution
(currently, most provisions under the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act are assumed to expire at the end of 2025).
In the euro area, under the reference forecast, the
primary deficit in Germany is expected to widen
by about 1 percent of GDP by 2030 relative to
2024 and by about 4 percent of GDP relative to the
January WEO forecast for 2030, with the increase
driven primarily by higher defense spending and
public investment, and this is assumed to generate
spillovers to France, Italy, and Spain. The euro area
debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase from its

CHAPTER 1

current 88 percent to 93 percent in 2030, although
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the
assessment of the economic impact of the additional
fiscal spending. In emerging market and developing
economies, primary fiscal deficits are projected to
widen in 2025 by 0.3 percentage point on average,
followed by fiscal tightening starting in 2026. In
China, the structural-fiscal-balance-to-GDP ratio is
expected to deteriorate by 1.2 percentage points in
2025. Public debt in emerging market and developing economies continues to rise from its current
level of 70 percent of GDP, reaching a projected
83 percent in 2030.
• Trade policy assumptions:
◦ Tariff announcements between February 1 and
April 4, with specific details on their implementation, are included in the reference forecast.
On February 1, executive orders signed by US
President Donald J. Trump imposed tariffs on
Canada, China, and Mexico. An additional tariff
of 10 percent on all imports from China came
into effect on February 4, and another 10 percent
was imposed on March 4. China responded with
tariffs of 10 to 15 percent on imports of select
US agricultural products, energy commodities,
and farm equipment, which took effect on
February 10, and on imports of agricultural products, which took effect on March 10. Tariffs of
25 percent on all nonenergy goods imports from
Canada (for energy, 10 percent) and of 25 percent on all imports from Mexico took effect on
March 4, with the exemption of goods compliant
with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada announced 25 percent
countertariffs on roughly 40 percent of Canadian
imports of goods from the United States. Mexico
indicated the intention to respond without
specifying the measures to be employed, hence
the reference forecast includes no additional tariff
imposed on Mexican imports from the United
States. The United States also expanded tariffs on
steel and aluminum, effective March 12, removing all exemptions to the 25 percent tariff on steel
imports and increasing the tariff rate on aluminum from 10 to 25 percent. On March 26, the
United States announced a 25 percent tariff on all
automobiles and auto parts, excluding US content
in auto and auto parts exports. This tariff came
into effect on April 3 for autos, while implementation for auto parts was postponed to May 3.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

The US Fair and Reciprocal Plan was introduced
on April 2, imposing a 10 percent minimum tariff on all countries other than Canada and Mexico
and country-specific rates as high as 50 percent
for roughly 60 countries. The universal 10 percent
minimum tariff took effect on April 5, and
the other tariffs were set to take effect on
April 9. Exemptions applied to categories of
goods deemed critical, such as pharmaceuticals,
semiconductors, energy, and certain minerals.
Countermeasures from Canada, announced
on April 3, consisted of 25 percent tariffs on
non-USMCA-compliant fully assembled vehicles
imported from the United States. On April 4,
China announced 34 percent tariffs, matching the
increase in US duties on imports from China, to
take effect on April 10.
◦ Under the reference forecast, trade policy uncertainty is assumed to remain elevated through
2025 and 2026. The perceived unpredictability
of the current trade landscape is evident from the
significant spike in the daily trade policy indicator
(Caldara and others 2020), which surged more
than four standard deviations in just three days
after April 2, despite the disclosure of the details
of the expected tariffs.

Growth Forecast
Global Growth: Reference Forecast and Alternatives
In the near term, under the reference forecast,
global growth is projected to fall from an estimated
3.3 percent in 2024 to 2.8 percent in 2025, before
recovering to 3 percent in 2026. This is lower than
the projections in the January 2025 WEO Update,
by 0.5 percentage point for 2025 and 0.3 percentage
point for 2026, with downward revisions for nearly all
countries (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). The downgrades are
broad-based across countries and reflect in large part
the direct effects of the new trade measures and their
indirect effects through trade linkage spillovers, heightened uncertainty, and deteriorating sentiment. As indicated in the illustrative model simulations presented in
Box 1.2, the growth impact of tariffs in the short term
varies across countries, depending on trade relationships, industry compositions, policy responses, and
opportunities for trade diversification. Fiscal support in
some cases (for example, China, euro area) offsets some
of the negative growth impact.

8 For world output, the quarterly estimates and projections account for approximately 90 percent of annual world output at purchasing-power-parity weights.

For emerging market and developing economies, the quarterly estimates and projections account for approximately 85 percent of annual emerging market and
developing economies’ output at purchasing-power-parity weights.

Given uncertainty over where trade policy could
settle, the two alternative growth outlooks are as
follows:
• Under the pre–April 2 forecast, global growth would
be 3.2 percent for both 2025 and 2026, lower by
0.1 percentage point in each year compared with the
January 2025 WEO Update. This forecast deviates
from the global assumptions listed above on trade
policy announcements, the level of uncertainty,
and commodity prices. It is predicated on higher

oil prices and only those trade policies announced
between February 1 and March 12, namely, tariffs
on Canada and Mexico, the first wave of tariffs on
China, associated responses by Canada and China,
and sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum. The
downgrades to growth under this outlook are largest
for the countries directly involved, but growth in
other economies is also lower because of increased
uncertainty relative to that in January and tariff-related spillovers.

1 Difference based on rounded figures for the current, January 2025 WEO Update, and October 2024 WEO forecasts.

• The post–April 9 model-based forecast incorporates
the tariff announcements made after April 4 and,
hence, not included in the reference forecast.
◦ On April 9, the United States announced a
90-day pause on the higher tariff rates imposed
on some countries but maintained the 10 percent
minimum on all countries while further raising
tariffs on Chinese goods as a countermeasure to
China’s tariff response, which China then countered again. The EU responded with 25 percent
tariffs on a range of US imports, which were also
paused for 90 days. On April 11, the United
States announced that it would exempt smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices and
components from the April 2 tariffs, while China
raised tariffs on US goods further, with the higher
rate taking effect on April 12. As of April 14—
the cutoff date for data and information used
in this chapter—the US effective tariff rate
on Chinese goods was 115 percent, while that
imposed by China on US goods was 146 percent,
and the US effective tariff rate on the world stood
at about 25 percent, up from under 3 percent in
January 2025.
◦ If the measures announced between April 5
and 14 were considered in isolation from the
associated market fallout and policy-induced
uncertainty and assumed to be permanent, global
growth for 2025 would be about 2.8 percent for

14

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

2025 and about 2.9 percent for 2026. This is
similar to the estimates for global growth in the
reference forecast, albeit with a different composition of growth rates across countries. The gains
from lower effective tariff rates for those countries that were previously subject to higher tariffs
would now be offset by poorer growth outcomes
in China and the United States—due to the escalating tariff rates—that would propagate through
global supply chains. Further, the losses in China
and the United States would become larger
in 2026 and beyond, while the gains in other
regions would fade, leading to weaker global
outcomes than the reference forecast.
Growth Forecast for Advanced Economies
For advanced economies, growth under the reference forecast is projected to drop from an estimated
1.8 percent in 2024 to 1.4 percent in 2025 and
1.5 percent in 2026. Growth for 2025 is now projected to be 0.5 percentage point lower relative to
that in January 2025 WEO Update projections. The
forecasts for 2025 include significant downward revisions for Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
United States and an upward revision for Spain.
• For the United States, growth is projected to decrease
in 2025 to 1.8 percent, 1 percentage point lower
than the rate for 2024 as well as 0.9 percentage point
lower than the forecast rate in the January 2025

CHAPTER 1

WEO Update. The downward revision is a result of
greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions, and a softer
demand outlook, given slower-than-anticipated consumption growth. Tariffs are also expected to weigh
on growth in 2026, which is projected at 1.7 percent
amid moderate private consumption.
• Growth in the euro area is expected to decline
slightly to 0.8 percent in 2025, before picking up
modestly to 1.2 percent in 2026. Rising uncertainty
and tariffs are key drivers of the subdued growth
in 2025. Offsetting forces that support the modest
pickup in 2026 include stronger consumption on
the back of rising real wages and a projected fiscal
easing in Germany following major changes to its
fiscal rule (the “debt brake”). Within the region,
Spain’s momentum contrasts with the sluggish
dynamics elsewhere. The growth projection for
2025 for Spain is 2.5 percent, an upward revision of
0.2 percentage point from that in the January 2025
WEO Update. This reflects a large carryover from
better-than-expected outturns in 2024 and reconstruction activity following floods.
• Among other advanced economies, several downward revisions stand out. For Canada, growth
forecasts are revised downward by 0.6 percentage point for 2025 and by 0.4 percentage point
for 2026. This largely reflects the new tariffs on
exports to the United States that came into effect
in March as well as heightened uncertainty and
geopolitical tensions. For Japan, the growth projection for 2025 is 0.6 percent, marking a downgrade
of 0.5 percentage point relative to the forecast in
January. The effect of tariffs announced on April 2
and associated uncertainty offset the expected
strengthening of private consumption, with
above-inflation wage growth boosting household
disposable income. For the United Kingdom, the
growth projection for 2025 is 1.1 percent, lower
by 0.5 percentage point compared to the forecast
in January. This reflects a smaller carryover from
2024, the impact of recent tariff announcements,
an increase in gilt yields, and weaker private
consumption amid higher inflation as a result of
regulated prices and energy costs.
Growth Forecast for Emerging Market and
Developing Economies
For emerging market and developing economies, growth
under the reference forecast is projected to drop to
3.7 percent in 2025 and 3.9 percent in 2026, following

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

an estimated 4.3 percent in 2024. This is 0.5 and
0.4 percentage point lower, respectively, compared with
the rate projected in the January 2025 WEO Update.
• After a marked slowdown in 2024, growth in
emerging and developing Asia is expected to decline
further to 4.5 percent in 2025 and 4.6 percent in
2026. Emerging and developing Asia, particularly
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries, has been among the most affected by
the April tariffs. For China, 2025 GDP growth is
revised downward to 4.0 percent from 4.6 percent
in the January 2025 WEO Update. This reflects the
impact of recently implemented tariffs, which offset
the stronger carryover from 2024 (as a result of a
stronger-than-expected fourth quarter) and fiscal
expansion in the budget. Growth in 2026 is also
revised downward to 4.0 percent from 4.5 percent
in the January 2025 WEO Update on the back of
prolonged trade policy uncertainty and the tariffs
now in place. For India, the growth outlook is
relatively more stable at 6.2 percent in 2025, supported by private consumption, particularly in rural
areas, but this rate is 0.3 percentage point lower
than that in the January 2025 WEO Update on
account of higher levels of trade tensions and global
uncertainty.
• For Latin America and the Caribbean, growth is
projected to moderate from 2.4 percent in 2024 to
2.0 percent in 2025, before rebounding to 2.4 percent in 2026. The forecasts are revised downward by
0.5 percentage point for 2025 and 0.3 percentage
point in 2026 compared with those in the January
2025 WEO Update. The revisions owe largely to
a significant downgrade to growth in Mexico, by
1.7 percentage points for 2025 and 0.6 percentage
point for 2026, reflecting weaker-than-expected
activity in late 2024 and early 2025 as well as the
impact of tariffs imposed by the United States, the
associated uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, and
a tightening of financing conditions.
• Growth in emerging and developing Europe is projected to slow down considerably, from 3.4 percent
in 2024 to 2.1 percent in 2025 and 2026. This
reflects a sharp drop in growth in Russia from
4.1 percent in 2024 to 1.5 percent in 2025 and to
0.9 percent in 2026 as private consumption and
investment decelerate amid reduced tightness in the
labor market and slower wage growth. Compared
with that projected in the January 2025 WEO
Update, growth in Russia has been revised slightly

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

15

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

upward for 2025 thanks to stronger-than-expected
outturns in the data for 2024. For Türkiye, growth is
projected to bottom out in 2025 at 2.7 percent and
accelerate to 3.2 percent in 2026, owing to recent
pivots in monetary policy.
• The Middle East and Central Asia is projected to
come out of several years of subdued growth, with
the rate accelerating from an estimated 2.4 percent
in 2024 to 3.0 percent in 2025 and to 3.5 percent
in 2026 as the effects of disruptions to oil production and shipping dissipate and the impact of
ongoing conflicts lessens. Compared with that in
January, the projection is revised downward, reflecting a more gradual resumption of oil production,
persistent spillovers from conflicts, and slower­than-expected progress on structural reforms.
• For sub-Saharan Africa, growth is expected
to decline slightly from 4 percent in 2024 to
3.8 percent in 2025 and recover modestly in 2026,
lifting to 4.2 percent. Among the larger economies,
the growth forecast in Nigeria is revised downward
by 0.2 percentage point for 2025 and 0.3 percentage point for 2026, owing to lower oil prices,
and that in South Africa is revised downward by
0.5 percentage point for 2025 and 0.3 percentage
point for 2026, reflecting slowing momentum from
a weaker-than-expected 2024 outturn, deteriorating sentiment due to heightened uncertainty, the
intensification of protectionist policies, and a deeper
slowdown in major economies. South Sudan has a
downward revision of 31.5 percentage points for
2025 on account of the delay in in the resumption
of oil production from a damaged pipeline.

Inflation Forecast
Under the reference forecast, global headline
inflation is expected to decline to 4.3 percent in 2025
and to 3.6 percent in 2026. Inflation is projected to
converge back to target earlier in advanced economies, reaching 2.2 percent in 2026, compared with
emerging market and developing economies, for which
it declines to 4.6 percent over the same time horizon. Compared with that in the January 2025 WEO
Update, the global inflation forecast is slightly higher.
For advanced economies, the inflation forecast for
2025 has been revised upward by 0.4 percentage point
since January. The United Kingdom and the United
States stand out in both the direction and the magnitude
of their revisions. Compared with those in the January

Note: In panel 1, the x-axis shows the months the World Economic Outlook (WEO) is
published. Panel 2 displays the distribution of one-year-ahead year-over-year inflation
projections from the WEO reports using estimated kernel densities. The panel shows
the 50 largest economies excluding Argentina, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Türkiye, and Ukraine. AEs = advanced economies; EMDEs = emerging
market and developing economies.

2025 WEO Update, the UK inflation forecast has been
revised upward by 0.7 percentage point and the US forecast by 1.0 percentage point. For the United States, this
reflects stubborn price dynamics in the services sector as
well as a recent uptick in the growth of the price of core
goods (excluding food and energy) and the supply shock
from recent tariffs. In the United Kingdom, it primarily
reflects one-off regulated price changes. In the euro area,
the forecast is unchanged.
Among emerging market and developing economies,
the revisions are mixed. In emerging and developing
Asia, inflationary pressures are expected to be even
more muted, with a downward revision of 0.5 percentage point to 2025 forecasts relative to those in
January. After a series of downward surprises, inflation
in China is expected to remain subdued (Figure 1.17,
panel 1). In emerging and developing Europe, Russia
and Ukraine have seen upward revisions for 2025,

CHAPTER 1

Medium-Term Outlook
Lacking structural reform momentum and facing
headwinds from a range of challenges, global economic
performance is expected to remain mediocre. The fiveyear-ahead growth forecast stands at 3.2 percent, below
the historical average during 2000–19 of 3.7 percent.
For many emerging market and developing economies,
as well as for quite a few advanced economies, current
medium-term growth forecasts fall short of those made
in 2020 (Figure 1.18). The fact that the moderation of
medium-term growth is more evident among emerging
market and developing economies implies a slowdown
in income convergence (Chapter 3 of the April 2024
WEO).
A key and increasingly common driver of these sluggish medium-term growth dynamics is demographics.
Population aging is expected to weigh significantly on
productivity, labor force participation, and ultimately,
growth (Chapter 2). Population movements across
borders could help alleviate some of the demographic
drag, and policies governing these movements can have
complex spillovers onto growth (Chapter 3).

and Russia for 2026, driving overall revisions of
1.5 percentage points in 2025 and 1.0 percentage
point in 2026. In Latin America and the Caribbean,
upward revisions for Bolivia, Brazil, and Venezuela
have been offset by downward revisions for Argentina
and elsewhere, bringing the overall revision for the
region for 2025 to –0.3 percentage point.
The inflation outlook as a whole has improved but
has not yet fully returned to prepandemic patterns
(Figure 1.17, panel 2), and it is subject to high uncertainty. In particular, the effects of recently imposed
tariffs on inflation across countries will depend on
whether the tariffs are perceived to be temporary or
permanent, the extent to which firms adjust margins to
offset increased import costs, and whether imports are
invoiced in US dollars or local currency (see Box 1.2).
Cross-country implications will differ too. Trade tariffs
act as a supply shock on tariffing countries, reducing
productivity and increasing unit costs. Tariffed countries face a negative demand shock as export demand
diminishes, exerting downward pressure on prices. In
both cases, trade uncertainty adds a layer of demand
shock as businesses and households respond by
postponing investment and spending, and this effect
may be amplified by tighter financial conditions and
increased exchange rate volatility.

World Trade Outlook
Global trade growth is expected to slow down in
2025 to 1.7 percentage point, a downward revision
of 1.5 percentage point since the January 2025 WEO
Update. This forecast reflects increased tariff restrictions affecting trade flows and, to a lesser extent, the
waning effects of cyclical factors that have underpinned
the recent rise in goods trade.
Meanwhile, global current account balances are
expected to narrow somewhat (Figure 1.19). The
widening of current account balances in 2024 reflected
widening domestic imbalances and a pickup in global
goods trade. Over the medium term, global balances
are expected to narrow gradually as the effects of these
factors wane. Creditor and debtor stock positions are
estimated to have increased in 2024, with the increases
reflecting widening current account balances. They are
expected to moderate slightly over the medium term
as current account balances gradually narrow. In some
economies, gross external liabilities remain large from a
historical perspective and pose risks of external stress.

Risks to the Outlook: Tilted to the
Downside
Overall, risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside, in both the short and the medium term.

uncertainties surrounding the outlook in detail.
Box 1.1 presents model-based analysis that quantifies
risks to the global outlook and plausible scenarios.

Downside Risks
Although some risks outlined in the January 2025
WEO Update have materialized and are now incorporated in the reference forecast, the likelihood of
additional adverse risks being realized is increasing.
Escalating trade measures and prolonged trade policy
uncertainty: Box 1.1 illustrates the impact of ratcheting up a trade war. World GDP would be negatively
affected, though the magnitude of the effect would
vary across countries. Those directly targeted by new
tariffs would be most affected, notably China and the

18

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

United States, but also a large set of countries in Asia
and Europe in the medium term. Some countries may
harness the opportunity to consolidate their trade networks, reconfigure their position in global value chains,
and, hence, experience positive effects, especially if
traded goods embed a rising share of domestic value
added, as seen in the case of Vietnam in 2018 (Schulze
and Xin, forthcoming). However, adverse effects could
accumulate over time. Their magnitude would depend
on how quickly countries can boost domestic consumption, reroute trade flows, and increase productivity and competitiveness, as well as on the reach and
intensity of the countermeasures, including nontariff
measures. The emergence of new trading clusters is
likely to fragment FDI flows and weigh on capital
accumulation (see Chapter 4 of the April 2024 WEO).
Rising geopolitical tensions could open up the possibility of sudden changes in the international monetary
system, with potential implications for macrofinancial
stability. A reversal of global economic integration
might also trigger suboptimal relocation of production
units and technological decoupling, with negative
growth effects in the longer term because of resource
misallocation, loss of knowledge hubs, contraction in
bank credit, and financial stability risks (Aiyar and
others 2023; Campos and others 2023; Gopinath and
others 2024; Chapter 2 of the April 2025 GFSR).
A trade war could also fuel inflationary pressures,
primarily through rising import prices (Fajgelbaum
and Khandelwal 2022). Although the simulations
in Box 1.1 indicate rather moderate effects, several
factors could lead to higher inflationary pressures in
some countries. First, with more than 80 percent of
trade invoicing in US dollars, additional pressure may
arise if the US dollar appreciates, as observed during
previous episodes of trade uncertainty and financial
market volatility. Second, inflation expectations are
currently higher than central bank targets and, in some
cases, on the rise. Third, restrictions on commodities
may lead to significant price shifts, particularly since
price elasticities of critical minerals and highly traded
agricultural goods are especially vulnerable to trade
fragmentation because of their concentrated production, difficulties in substitution, and essential roles in
manufacturing and key technologies (see Chapter 3 of
the October 2023 WEO). Price increases are also likely
to have negative distributional effects across and within
countries. Tariffs on agricultural commodities could
raise food security concerns, particularly in low-income
countries. Tariffs tend to raise prices of tradables, on

which poor households spend relatively more (Cravino
and Levchenko 2017; Carroll and Hur 2020), and
may increase returns to capital over labor, benefiting
the wealthy. Welfare losses are typically concentrated
among the poor and the retired, even when tariff revenues offset distortionary taxes (Carroll and Hur 2023).
Beyond the risk of additional trade barriers, prolonged uncertainty regarding trade policies poses other
risks to investment and growth (Box 1.1 shows the
effect of increased uncertainty over macroeconomic
policies more generally). In just the first quarter
of 2025, the number of new restrictive measures
announced increased by 16 percent relative to that in
December 2024, with actions ratcheting from April 2
onward. Firms’ concerns about fragmentation spiked
along with the escalation in the use of restrictive
measures (Figure 1.20). If uncertainty remains high
for long, firms may delay investment projects, with a
consequent reduction in global investment. Indeed,
empirically, trade uncertainty is estimated to have

show the effects of a 10 percent appreciation in the nominal US dollar index with
90 percent confidence intervals. Real GDP is measured in national currencies at
constant prices. “Advanced economies” exclude countries with weights in the US
dollar index that are larger than 4 percent in 2020: Canada, France, Germany,

are based on Carrière-Swallow and others’ (2021) bilateral pass-through and foreign
exchange depreciation against the US dollar between mid-September 2024 and the
beginning of January 2025. Data labels in the figure use International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) country codes. EMDE = emerging market and developing

reduced US investment by approximately 1.5 percent
in 2018 (Caldara and others 2020). Moreover, uncertainty diminishes demand by undermining confidence
and erodes consumer income in the medium term by
curtailing investment and stifling trade (Handley and
Limão 2017). Previous episodes of heightened trade
policy uncertainty led to persistent appreciation of the
US dollar (Albrizio and others, forthcoming), harming
exports from the United States and dollarized countries
and generating negative spillovers to emerging market
and developing economies. If, in the current episode,
a US dollar appreciation was to materialize, inflation
pressures could be sizable where country-specific circumstances amplify the amount of pass-through from
currency depreciation (Figure 1.21), especially in periods of high uncertainty and already-elevated inflation

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

levels (Carrière-Swallow and others 2024). However,
the policy-uncertainty-driven surge in risk aversion
and the decline in US growth prospects might lead to
a depreciation of the US dollar. A disorderly and large
depreciation of the US dollar could bring additional
financial market volatility.
Financial market volatility and correction: In some
countries, if inflation persists or regains upward
momentum because of new policies, central banks may
maintain interest rates at higher levels than currently
anticipated. This could result in cross-country interest
rate differentials, which could trigger capital outflows,
and tighter financial conditions, especially in emerging
market and developing economies (as illustrated in
Box 1.1). Financial market risks may be compounded
by future corporate earnings failing to meet expectations, large and unpredictable policy shifts, or renewed
geopolitical risks (see Chapter 2 of the April 2025
GFSR). The US dollar would typically be expected to
appreciate if financial conditions deteriorate sharply,
but the international monetary system could experience
a sudden reset, with potentially major implications for
the dollar as its main pillar. Worsening global financial
conditions and broader disruptions to the system could
trigger balance of payments crises in small countries
with limited market access, high refinancing needs, and
weak negotiation capacity. These risks may be amplified for commodity exporters amid a continued decline
in commodity prices, particularly those for oil and copper, which typically serve as indicators of an impending
recession by signaling a slowdown in industrial activity
in importers, such as China. A deeper financial market
correction than what was recently experienced could
be triggered by weaker-than-expected US growth, in
part induced by policy shifts, and reverberate through
highly leveraged positions in nonbank financial institutions and firms with high near-term refinancing needs.
In addition, an excessive rollback of financial regulations may lead to boom-bust dynamics, with negative
repercussions for household wealth, raising systemic
stress and creating adverse spillover effects throughout
the global economy. In Europe, a market correction
may occur if peace negotiations in Ukraine fail to reach
a lasting resolution.
Rising long-term interest rates: Further pressure on
already-high US bond yields, coupled with persistent
exchange rate volatility driven by additional policy
shifts and sustained policy uncertainty, could also trigger capital and FDI outflows from emerging market
and developing economies. The growing concentration

20

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

of capital in safe haven countries and assets could exacerbate capital imbalances and misallocation. Moreover,
the structural pressure on long-term yields could constrain the fiscal space, already limited, that is necessary
to heal the economic scars left by the pandemic or
meet new spending needs, or it could exacerbate fiscal
sustainability concerns, especially in high-debt countries (see the April 2025 Fiscal Monitor). Consequently,
this could lead to a debt spiral dynamic in which
borrowing costs escalate as fiscal adjustments become
increasingly unattainable.
Rising social discontent: The legacy of the cost-ofliving crisis, combined with reduced medium-term
growth prospects, may exacerbate polarization and
social unrest, hindering necessary reforms for growth.
Currently, the risk of unrest is pronounced in Africa,
where conflicts and rising food and energy prices have
had a severe impact on vulnerable nations with limited
fiscal space, and in Asia, where democratic participation in some incumbent regimes is limited and inequalities are rising (Barrett and others 2022). Although
emerging market and developing economies have
demonstrated resilience over the past four years, their
capacity to manage domestic challenges, especially high
debt levels, in a deteriorating global environment may
be tested. A resurgence in food and energy price inflation, driven by commodity market fragmentation or
intensification of climate-related disasters, could worsen
living conditions and heighten food security concerns,
particularly in low-income countries. Across regions,
a common element of social unrest episodes relates to
discontent about public representation and governance,
which may increase the likelihood of structural reform
failure (see Chapter 3 of the October 2024 WEO).
Increasing challenges to international cooperation: The
increasing frequency and economic cost of natural disasters (Figure 1.22) and the intensification of conflicts—
disruptive, even if localized—demand continuous and
coordinated international action. Scaling back climate
adaptation and international aid would risk making past
investments ineffective, undermining progress toward a
greener and more resilient economy and eroding human
capital where it is most needed. If a lack of financial
support were suddenly to materialize, living and health
conditions would deteriorate in low-income and fragile
countries, which might face social unrest and be forced
to rely on public financing, further exacerbating their
debt vulnerabilities. The macroeconomic consequences
for aid-receiving countries might be substantial, including worsening of current accounts, decline in foreign

reserves, pressure on exchange rates and prices, and
lower consumption and investment.
Labor supply gaps: Many nations have relied on
foreign workers to address labor shortages, particularly
following COVID-19. While a retrenchment of foreign-worker flows to advanced economies might ease
strains on local services and infrastructure and provide
a small boost to incomes, output would decline in
recipient countries—and globally—in the long term
(see Chapter 3). The resulting decline in labor supply
may pose fiscal sustainability risks and hinder potential
growth, especially in countries where legal immigrants
tend to be well integrated and their skills meet and
complement labor market needs.

Upside Risks
Despite the increased prevalence of negative risks,
some factors could lead to more favorable outcomes
than those in the reference forecast.

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Next-generation trade agreements: Continued elevated
trade policy uncertainty could spark new momentum
toward regional, plurilateral, and multilateral agreements, which could mitigate risks and foster policy
predictability. Nondiscriminatory agreements that
cover a broad set of areas, including digital and services
trade and investment, could facilitate broad-based
gains without introducing new distortions. Ultimately,
expanding and deepening international cooperation
and regional integration (for example, the EU’s single
market) could increase investment, boost productivity,
raise potential growth, and enhance countries’ resilience to external shocks, by expanding the reference
market and diversifying trading partners (Albrizio and
others 2025).
Mitigation of conflicts: A resolution or mitigation
of ongoing conflicts could lead to a decrease in global
commodity prices and reallocate resources for productive uses. The economic impact of war can be substantial, with studies showing that the “war tax” on growth
can reach 30 percent of GDP, contributing to inflation
rates as high as 15 percent (Federle and others 2024),
with neighboring countries most affected on average.
Cessation of hostilities, along with subsequent reconstruction efforts, would not only boost GDP growth
in countries directly involved in conflicts but would
also have a positive influence on neighboring nations.
This influence could manifest itself through the
alleviation of negative spillovers, which are estimated
to be on average between 5 percent and 10 percent of
GDP over the five to seven years following the onset
of conflict (see Chapter 2 of the April 2024 Regional
Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia),
and through the generation of positive spillovers.
For instance, a ceasefire in Ukraine has the potential
to raise growth in the region, through a rebound in
consumer confidence and reduction in energy prices,
especially in Europe. However, countries that have
invested in alternative infrastructures or energy sources
to manage conflict-related shortages may experience
negative spillovers for some time if reversals prevent
them from achieving the expected returns.
Structural reform momentum: A generalized acceleration of structural reforms, partly reinforced by peer
benchmarking among nations and challenging global
macroeconomic conditions, could significantly boost
growth. Streamlining regulations and reducing red tape
would unlock market entry and increase competition,
enhancing business dynamism and resource reallocation (as Box 1.1 illustrates for the case of China). More

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

integrated financial, labor, and product markets could
provide the depth and scale to drive more innovation
and accelerate productivity growth. In Europe, tackling
remaining internal barriers would allow firms to scale
up. Accelerating European integration by reducing regulatory obstacles and strengthening the Capital Markets Union could increase investment, lift productivity,
and raise potential growth. Such an approach would
bolster the underdeveloped European capital market,
contributing to a reduction of global imbalances.
Growth engine powered by artificial intelligence (AI):
Optimism about AI, coupled with an expected significant annual reduction in AI usage costs and future
technological advancements, could boost productivity
and consumption significantly. The integration of AI
technologies could lead to knowledge spillovers across
industries and regions, fostering innovation and driving down costs globally. These gains could materialize
without significant adverse effects on employment if
AI adoption is accompanied with policies that upgrade
regulatory frameworks and support labor reallocation
(Cazzaniga and others 2024). They could also materialize without escalating electricity prices and environmental costs if policymakers, in collaboration with
businesses, seize the opportunity by embracing and
incentivizing renewable energy sources and innovative
production paradigms (see the Commodity Special
Feature).

Policies: Navigating Uncertainty and
Enhancing Preparedness to Ease
Macroeconomic Trade-Offs
The global economy is at a critical juncture, with
substantial policy pivots and uncertainty. A range of
plausible alternatives are possible, shaped by rapidly
changing trade policies. In the face of ongoing
structural shifts, heightened uncertainty, and persistently weak growth, policies should focus on steps
to restore confidence and stability, reduce imbalances,
and sustainably lift growth. Reducing policy-induced
uncertainty and resolving trade tensions can promote
a more stable environment, bolster consumption, and
facilitate investment. In the short term, countries need
to calibrate monetary and prudential policies carefully
to maintain price and financial stability. Gradually
rebuilding fiscal space remains critical for managing
increased public spending needs and building sufficient buffers to address future shocks, which could be
sizable and recurrent. To uplift growth prospects in the

22

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

medium term, it remains urgent to deliver on structural reforms, while prudently harnessing the benefits
of technological advances.

Managing Trade Tensions and Prolonged
Elevated Trade Policy Uncertainty
Delivering a stable and predictable trade environment:
Countries should work constructively to urgently
resolve trade tensions and promote clear and transparent trade policies to stabilize expectations, avoid
investment distortions, and reduce volatility while
avoiding steps that could further harm the world economy (Georgieva 2025). In the wake of greater trade
policy uncertainty, pragmatic cooperation and deeper
economic integration (Rotunno and Ruta, forthcoming) can help countries expand trade either through
nondiscriminatory unilateral reductions of trade
barriers or at the regional, plurilateral, or multilateral
level, as free trade agreements (accession of the United
Kingdom to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the EU–New
Zealand trade agreement) have shown. Greater regional
integration, such as that involved in deepening the
EU single market (October 2024 Regional Economic
Outlook: Europe) or continuing efforts toward African
Continental Free Trade Area implementation (El
Ganainy and others 2023) can similarly enhance global
efficiency even in the presence of distortionary trade
policies.
Broad subsidies generate large fiscal costs and
additional distortions and are thus not a well-suited
tool for countering domestic or external distortions.
However, in specific cases, targeted industrial policies
can alleviate sectoral market failures as a result of externalities or economies of scale. Yet industrial policies
are costly and can lead to various forms of government
failures, in turn leading to misallocation of resources
(Ilyina, Pazarbasioglu, and Ruta 2024). Poorly targeted
industrial policies can drive production away from
underlying patterns of comparative advantage, create
regional or global oversupply, and result in changes in
terms of trade that reduce domestic welfare (Hodge
and others 2024). Amid limited fiscal space, industrial
policy programs should be subjected to a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. To minimize distortions,
industrial policies should be targeted narrowly to
specific objectives in sectors in which externalities or
market failures are well identified. Finally, cooperation regarding industrial policy approaches among

CHAPTER 1

international trading partners can reduce negative
spillovers (Brandão-Marques and Toprak 2024).
Preserve international cooperation. International
cooperation, including cooperation through regional
and cross-regional groups, is essential to sustain global
growth, tackle common problems, and mitigate
cross-country spillovers. In several policy areas, including trade, industrial policy, international taxation,
climate, and development and humanitarian assistance,
international cooperation and platforms can mitigate
global spillovers and protect the vulnerable (Aiyar
and others 2023). International tax cooperation can
diminish the effects of ongoing harmful tax competition by preventing a race to the bottom in global
corporate taxes. In low-income countries, multilateral assistance will become even more important for
addressing budget and development needs if bilateral
foreign aid flows decline.

Maintaining Price and Financial Stability
Calibrate monetary policy amid two-sided risks. As
countries are experiencing a multifaceted combination
of shocks, central banks need to carefully calibrate
monetary policy to country-specific circumstances.
Trade policy shocks adversely weigh on supply while
persistent uncertainty and negative wealth effects
from the April 2025 asset price correction dampen
aggregate demand. As these shocks unfold, central
banks should monitor the interplay of sectoral supply
pressures and sectoral demand, because a steepening of
sectoral supply curves could trigger renewed inflationary pressures (see Chapter 2 of the October 2024
WEO). Where near-term inflation risks are tilted to
the upside or inflation expectations are rising, future
cuts to the policy rate should remain contingent on
evidence that inflation is heading decisively back
toward target. This can ensure inflation expectations
remain anchored while guarding against the risk of
premature monetary policy easing followed by later
rate hikes. Without price stability, any gains from
future growth are at risk of being more than offset by
a renewed cost-of-living squeeze. Central banks need
to be particularly vigilant regarding those risks after
the recent period of prolonged inflation and should
be ready to act forcefully, because inflation expectations may be much less stable in instances of renewed
inflationary pressures. If growth is declining or labor
markets are softening while inflationary pressures and
inflation expectations are clearly returning toward

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

target, maintaining a constant level of nominal policy
rates will, over time, result in a restrictive real policy
stance as inflation declines while growth weakens. In
these circumstances, gradual reductions in the policy
rate to move the policy stance closer to the neutral
rate are appropriate. Overall, in the face of elevated
uncertainty, there is a premium on clear communication, which can enhance predictability for all economic agents.
Elevated uncertainty also intensifies the trade-off
between anchoring inflation expectations and safeguarding financial stability. Where central banks’
efforts to stabilize inflation expectations lead to a
tightening of financial conditions, this may exacerbate
vulnerabilities within the financial system, complicating operations for financial institutions (Bergant and
others 2025). Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance
between maintaining stable inflation expectations and
ensuring that financial stability is not compromised,
particularly amid financial market volatility.
Mitigate disruptive foreign exchange volatility. Persistent trade policy uncertainty, broader policy shifts,
cross-country divergence in paths to monetary policy
normalization, and a more volatile currency outlook
could further amplify recent bouts of financial market
volatility. This could trigger disruptive capital outflows,
which would particularly affect countries with higher
import dependence or a greater share of dollar-invoiced
imports. The IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework provides guidance tailored to country-specific conditions
on appropriate policy responses.
In countries with well-functioning and deep foreign
exchange markets and low levels of foreign-currency
debt, exchange rate flexibility and raising policy rates
are advisable. Financial market policies, including
rapid, decisive, and well-designed liquidity support, are
suitable tools for mitigating bouts of foreign exchange
market volatility that emanate from trade partners’ policies or from US dollar movements. At the same time,
for countries with shallow foreign exchange markets or
sizable amounts of foreign-currency-denominated debt,
an abrupt tightening of global financial conditions may
trigger disruptive foreign exchange volatility and rising
risk premiums, which could pose risks to macrofinancial stability. In these circumstances, while maintaining
suitable monetary and fiscal policies, temporary foreign
exchange interventions or capital flow management
measures could be appropriate. These should be complemented with macroprudential measures to mitigate
disruptions from large foreign-currency-denominated

debt holdings and financial market reforms to deepen
domestic capital markets over the medium term.
Safeguard financial stability through prudential policy.
High uncertainty about the economic outlook and
financial market volatility puts a premium on robust
prudential policies to safeguard financial stability. Jurisdictions experiencing financial market stress should
release available macroprudential buffers to support the
provision of credit to the economy and avoid a broad
tightening of financial conditions and cascades of
business failures and bankruptcies. Should stress levels
reach crisis proportions, authorities should be ready to
deploy liquidity and fiscal instruments to avoid excessive deleveraging and damage to the real sector. Where
regulatory changes are being implemented, financial
stability policies—including macroprudential policies and Basel III reforms—should be maintained to
strengthen the supervision of financial institutions and
the monitoring of financial stability risks. Enhancing
reporting requirements and strengthening policies to
mitigate vulnerabilities in nonbank financial institutions are crucial for reaping the benefits of the latter’s
role in financial intermediation.

Rebuilding Fiscal Buffers to Regain Budgetary
Maneuver Space
Restoring fiscal space and putting public debt on
a sustainable path, while meeting important spending needs to ensure national and economic security,
remains a priority. This requires credible medium-term
fiscal consolidation with decisive yet growth-friendly
adjustments. Greater fiscal discipline would also help
contain borrowing costs and thus provide a guardrail
against the risk of high or higher interest rates amid
higher term premiums and upside risks to inflation
in some countries. Fiscal adjustment plans should
focus primarily on credibly rebuilding buffers to keep
financing costs reasonable, help anchor medium-term
inflation expectations, and contain risks relating to sovereign rating downgrades. Moreover, countries should
reprioritize expenditures and boost fiscal revenues,
including by broadening their tax bases; permanent
increases in spending should be financed with revenues, and a greater focus on enhancing public sector
spending efficiency may be warranted, particularly if
fiscal space is constrained. Where negative demand
shocks from recent tariffs and trade policies are large,
automatic stabilizers can dampen their impact. New
discretionary measures—designed to be well targeted

24

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

and temporary and with clear sunset clauses—should
be deployed only for households, firms, or industries
affected by severe trade dislocations.
Devise adjustment plans to restore fiscal sustainability.
For many countries, current fiscal policies fall short of
what is needed to ensure that debt has a high probability of stabilizing (Chapter 1 of the April 2025 Fiscal
Monitor). A credible fiscal adjustment plan would
be grounded in realistic assumptions about growth,
debt-servicing costs, revenue mobilization, and spending needs. For countries where new spending needs
arise, demonstrating a clear commitment to safeguarding debt sustainability, the integrity of fiscal rules,
and fiscal policy transparency are crucial. In countries
with fiscal space, net expenditures, excluding defense
investment, should remain bound to already-agreedupon commitments. In economies with limited fiscal
space, both permanent and temporary increases in
fiscal outlays should be financed by fiscal revenues and
spending reprioritization.
The strengthening of medium-term fiscal frameworks and fiscal rules can support fiscal adjustment
plans, as can greater fiscal transparency, including that
in regard to contingent liabilities and debt-creating
flows outside the fiscal deficit. Binding legislation and
clear contingencies on how governments will respond
to unexpected changes in economic conditions—
changes in growth, interest rates, or spending
needs—under realistic assumptions can further bolster
credibility.
For countries in or at high risk of debt distress or
facing potential noncompliance with fiscal regulations,
achieving fiscal sustainability may require not only
fiscal consolidation, but also debt restructuring. Furthermore, progress in the implementation of international sovereign debt resolution frameworks, including
the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework,
and increased consensus at the Global Sovereign Debt
Roundtable (GSDR), will make debt restructuring
(when necessary) less costly.
Enact targeted fiscal reforms. Careful design and
composition of fiscal adjustment plans can prevent
prolonged negative growth effects, with specific
policy mixes requiring country-specific calibration.
In advanced economies, expenditure reprioritization,
entitlement reforms, and revenue increases through
indirect taxes or removal of inefficient incentives,
depending on countries’ circumstances, can support
fiscal adjustment (April 2025 Fiscal Monitor). Emerging market and developing economies have greater

CHAPTER 1

space to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization,
needed to meet spending needs and boost job creation.
Measures include broadening tax bases, by reducing
informality as well as taking other measures, and
enhancing revenue administration capacity. Across
countries, there is scope for reducing inefficient subsidies. Gradual reforms, announced and implemented
during more favorable macroeconomic conditions and
combined with redistribution policies, can enhance
public support for major expenditure reform in
areas such as energy subsidies and pension reform
(Chapter 2 of the April 2025 Fiscal Monitor).
Protect growth and the vulnerable. Fiscal adjustments need to be carefully calibrated to avoid negative
impacts on potential growth and mitigate distributional impacts. Growth-friendly elements of spending,
such as high-quality public investments in infrastructure and digitalization, can lift medium-term growth
potential and should be protected. Spending on
growth priorities can be complemented with structural
reforms to labor markets and regulation. Protecting
the poor and the vulnerable can further cushion the
impact on inequality and enhance social acceptability
of fiscal reforms. Eliminating poorly targeted subsidies
such as those for energy can simultaneously reduce
distributional impacts and contribute toward achieving
climate-related objectives.
Use timely, targeted, temporary support where essential, in a responsible way. For countries where negative
demand shocks are large, automatic stabilizers should
play their role in dampening the shocks’ impact.
Where large shocks and severe trade dislocations have
a serious negative impact on households, firms, or
sectors, additional targeted and temporary support
could be deployed. Such measures need to be appropriately designed to ensure proper targeting, include
automatic sunset clauses to avoid entrenched support
that prevents adjustment and reallocation, and mitigate
fiscal and political economy risks. Responsibly adjusting the fiscal envelope to support such new support,
based on country-specific fiscal space consideration,
is critical to ensuring that public debt remains on a
sustainable path.

Reinvigorating Medium-Term Growth
Potential growth remains subdued and cost-of-living
pressures persist in the aftermath of the pandemic.
Lifting medium-term growth prospects is the only sustainable way to achieve a broad-based increase in living

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

standards and ease macroeconomic trade-offs. Higher
growth would support debt sustainability dynamics, thus increasing fiscal space in the medium term.
Broad-based structural reforms can contribute to raising growth potential, and multilateral cooperation can
support resilience in the wake of elevated uncertainty.
Enact structural reforms. Durable structural reforms
across several areas, including labor markets, education,
regulation and competition, and financial sector policies, can jointly lift productivity and potential growth
and support job creation. In addition, technological
progress, including that related to digitalization and
AI, can enhance productivity and potential growth.
Increasing female labor force participation can
increase labor supply. Amid continued but uneven
population aging in both advanced economies and
emerging market and developing economies, policies
to improve human capital and the labor outcomes
of older workers, including health policies and those
pertaining to continued training and development, can
improve those workers’ labor market attachment and
productivity (Chapter 2). A well-designed mix of labor
market interventions can also contribute to gradually
raising the effective retirement age. In addition to
domestic labor market policies, evidence suggests that
increased migration flows can attenuate challenging
demographic outlooks while mildly boosting growth
(Chapter 3). This requires facilitating the swift labor
market integration of migrants (Caselli and others
2024) and ensuring that skills are well matched with
job opportunities (Beltran Saavedra and others 2024).
Measures to attenuate the distributional impacts of
labor market reforms, as well as governance reforms,
can further strengthen trust in public institutions (see
Chapter 3 of the October 2024 WEO). Robust regulatory frameworks coupled with investments in digital
infrastructure and a digitally competent workforce
are critical to ensure gains from new technologies are
broadly shared across the workforce (Georgieva 2024).
Targeted deregulation can ease constraints hindering
firms from stimulating entrepreneurship, investment,
and innovation, thus ultimately boosting medium-term
growth potential. Estimates suggest sizable distortions
and real GDP costs averaging 0.8 percent of annual
GDP for a set of European countries (Pellegrino and
Zheng 2024). Maintaining prudential regulations
and safeguarding financial stability remain key when
reducing bureaucracy. Premature or uncoordinated
deregulation would increase financial stability risks and
could fuel dangerous boom-bust dynamics.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Labor market and regulatory reform should be
complemented with policies to alleviate financial constraints. Increasing financial accessibility and reducing
financial barriers to efficient capital allocation could
further boost productivity growth (see Chapter 3
of the April 2024 WEO). Removing internal trade
barriers and advancing capital market reforms are
critical for business dynamism, notably that among
innovation-intensive firms that lack tangible collateral
(see Note One of the October 2024 Regional Economic
Outlook: Europe).
Although structural reforms have been well identified for several years, securing broad social acceptability
for such reforms has often been a significant obstacle.
To increase the likelihood structural reforms will succeed and to enhance the social acceptability of reform
agendas, participative processes are needed, coupled

26

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

with efforts to strengthen public understanding of
reform proposals and continued stakeholder engagement throughout the reform process (see Chapter 3 of
the October 2024 World Economic Outlook; Chapter 2
of the April 2025 Fiscal Monitor).
Make progress on climate policies. Addressing climate
change requires a well-designed policy mix that can
generate macroeconomic benefits, including low-carbon, resilient growth. This includes investments in
renewable and energy-efficient technologies and economy-wide measures such as carbon pricing, which can be
complemented by fiscal incentives, technical assistance, and financial support for adaptation projects in
low-income countries. Many countries are transitioning
from fossil fuels to renewables, which can help improve
energy security (Dolphin and others 2024), benefit
employment, and reduce balance of payments risks.

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.1. Risk Assessment Surrounding the Reference Forecast
This box presents two complementary assessments
of risks to the global economy. First, it uses the IMF’s
Group of Twenty (G20) model to derive confidence
bands around the World Economic Outlook (WEO)
reference forecast. Second, based on the IMF’s Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model, it simulates two scenarios. Policies and shocks in scenario A
result in a widening in global imbalances and a fall in
global output relative to those in the reference forecast;
policies in scenario B result instead in a narrowing of
global imbalances and an increase in global output
relative to those in the reference forecast.

Confidence Bands
The first assessment identifies the economic shocks
underlying historical data using the G20 model. It
then resamples these shocks and feeds them back
through the model to generate risk distributions
(Andrle and Hunt 2020). The procedure has been
adjusted to align with the growth-at-risk assessment
presented in the April 2025 Global Financial Stability
Report (GFSR). As in the previous assessment in the
October 2024 WEO, growth distributions are skewed
to the downside, and inflation distributions are somewhat skewed to the upside.1
Panels 1 and 2 in Figure 1.1.1 show the distributions for US growth and headline inflation, respectively (90 percent confidence bands represented in
the blue-shaded areas). The probability of a recession
occurring in 2025 is now assessed at 37 percent,
higher than in the October 2024 WEO.2 Risks have
moved farther to the upside for US inflation and
policy rates (not shown), in part reflecting the upward
revision to projected inflation in the WEO reference
The authors of this box are Michal Andrle, Jared Bebee,
Domenico Giannone, Chris Jackson, Dirk Muir, Rafael Portillo,
and Philippe Wingender.
1Aligning with the growth-at-risk assessment requires sampling
some recession years more often: 1969, 1974–75, 1981, and to a
lesser extent 2009 and 2020.
2The recession risk for 2025 is defined as the probability that
2025 annual growth will be below 1.2 percent, consistent with a
shallow recession starting in the third quarter. The probability of
a short-lived US recession in 2025, according to this criterion,
was assessed to be about 25 percent at the time of the October
2024 World Economic Outlook (WEO).

forecast. The risk that 2025 US headline inflation will
rise above 3.5 percent is now more than 30 percent,
compared with 13 percent back in October; the probability that the average 2025 three-month Treasury
bill rate will rise above 4.5 percent for 2025 is about
33 percent (up from 27 percent in October).
Panels 3 and 4 in Figure 1.1.1 show the distributions for global growth and headline inflation. The
probability that global growth in 2025 will fall below
2 percent is assessed at close to 30 percent, higher
than the assessment done in October (17 percent).
The probability that global headline inflation will
rise above 5 percent is estimated at about 31 percent,
slightly lower than the corresponding estimate of
34 percent at the time of the October WEO.

Scenarios
The GIMF model is next used to simulate two
scenarios. The version of the model used here has
10 regions, including China, the United States, and
the euro area.
The scenarios assume monetary policy responds
endogenously, with floating exchange rates in most
regions. In scenario A, China’s currency is managed
relative to the dollar through capital flow measures,
allowing some exchange rate adjustment in response
to shocks but by less than what would be implied by
a fully floating regime; in scenario B, the renminbi
adjusts as in a flexible exchange rate regime. On the
fiscal side, automatic stabilizers are allowed to operate.

Layers Considered in Scenario A
Global divergences. The layer has three components:
• Renewal of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
Scenario A assumes renewal of a broad set of
provisions in the TCJA for a period of 10 years,
including individual and business taxes, the child
tax credit, and expensing of investment, totaling
about 11 percent of GDP over 2025–34. The
accompanying deficits are back-loaded, reaching
about 1.4 percent of GDP by 2027. Because the
renewal comes after a historical inflation surge, the
layer assumes a small additional temporary increase
in US inflation expectations.
• Lower productivity in Europe. The recent slowdown
in productivity growth in the euro area deepens as
a result of lower innovation, technological shifts,
and lack of access to equity funding. Total factor
productivity growth declines by 0.2 percentage
point per year over five years, relative to that in the

28

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

reference forecast, starting in 2025. The decline is
concentrated in the tradables sector.
• Weaker domestic demand in China. Consumption
and investment fall relative to those in the reference
forecast by 0.7 and 0.5 percent, respectively, in 2025.
The decline builds over 2026–27 and fades after that.
Trade war. The scenario assumes a ratcheting up
of tariffs in response to the April 2 announcement.
First, it incorporates an additional 50 percentage
point increase in tariffs on all China-US trade in both
directions relative to the reference forecast in this
report. Second, countries other than China respond
tit for tat to the April 2 announcement, raising tariffs
on imports from the United States by the same rate.
Third, the United States responds by doubling the
rate announced on April 2 to all countries other
than China. As a result, there is an increase of about
18 percentage points in the effective tariff rate on both
US goods imports and US goods exports, relative to
the current reference forecast.
Increase in global uncertainty. Uncertainty over
macroeconomic policies increases. The resulting shock is
equivalent to a three-standard-deviation increase in the
global economic policy uncertainty measure in Davis
(2016), about 50 percent larger than the spike observed
in 2018–19. Regions more directly exposed to tariff measures, or where trade represents a larger share of activity,
experience a somewhat greater uncertainty shock.
Tighter financial conditions. The combination of
shocks in the scenario triggers a tightening in financial conditions. Asset prices decline globally in 2025,
with the largest decline in the US (about 5 percent on
average for the year) and in emerging markets (about
3 percent). Sovereign and corporate premiums in
emerging markets excluding China increase by 50 basis
points; corporate premiums in advanced economies
and China increase by 25 basis points. The tightening
in financial conditions lasts for two years.

Layers Considered in Scenario B
Lower US government debt. The United States
embarks on a series of fiscal reforms to reduce inefficiencies from poorly targeted tax expenditures, shift
from labor to consumption taxes, and contain health
care costs. In addition, government consumption is
permanently reduced. These reforms, alongside savings
from lower interest payments, lead to a gradual decline
of the overall fiscal deficit, which reaches 1 percent of
GDP after five years. The US public debt declines by
25 percentage points of GDP in the long term.

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.1 (continued)
Higher public spending in Europe. Public investment increases in the euro area starting in 2025. It
reaches 1 percent of GDP in additional spending
by 2026, stays at that level until 2030, and remains
permanently higher by 0.4 percent after that to sustain
a higher stock of public capital.3 The latter raises
total factor productivity and potential output permanently. The layer also includes a permanent increase
in defense spending of 0.3 percent of GDP, starting
in 2025. Over the WEO horizon, about two-thirds of
the surge in spending is financed by higher deficits.
From 2030 onward, however, the increase in public
capital and defense spending is offset by a reallocation
of existing spending, such that debt ratios gradually
return to those in the reference forecast.
Productivity gains and rebalancing in China. Structural reforms that reduce barriers to entry and reforms
to state-owned enterprises lead to increased market
dynamism, and strengthening of the social safety net
leads to demand-side rebalancing. Productivity in the
tradables and nontradables sectors increases by about 2
and 0.5 percent, respectively, through 2030, boosting
sentiment in the short run. The saving rate decreases
by 2 percentage points of GDP over the same period.

Impact on World Economy
Figures 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 present the effects, for scenarios A and B, on the level of GDP during 2024–30
and in the long term, for China, the United States,
the euro area, and the world. Effects are presented
as percent deviations from the reference forecast.4
Figure 1.1.4 shows the total effects of the scenarios
on the current account balances of these three main
regions as deviations from the reference forecast in
percentage points of GDP.
In scenario A, the global divergences layer is somewhat stimulative for the US economy as a result of
the TCJA renewal. The impact is limited initially but
3The scenario is similar to the scenario considered in the

October WEO, but the increase in public investment is smaller
and the financing assumption is somewhat different. The October
scenario was implemented using a different model, the G20
model, leading to some differences in multipliers and spillovers.
4The impact on growth rates is approximated by subtracting
the effect on output from the previous year.

builds over time. Over 2025–26, the layer adds 20–30
basis points to US headline inflation and 30 basis
points to the US policy rate and results in a modest
appreciation of the dollar. Lower productivity in Europe
reduces euro area activity gradually. The component
lowers GDP by about 0.3 and 0.5 percent in 2025
and 2026. As demand falls in lockstep with potential, the impact on the region’s inflation and policy
rates is close to zero. Lower domestic demand in China
subtracts 0.3 and 0.5 percent from China’s reference
forecast GDP in 2025 and 2026, respectively, with
the decreases reflecting mainly lower consumption.
The component reduces China’s headline inflation by
an additional 20–30 basis points in 2025–26, with
the effects amplified by limited adjustment of the
renminbi-to-dollar exchange rate.
The trade war layer reduces global demand,
especially for US and Chinese goods. Differences in
US tariff rates across countries create scope for trade

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.1 (continued)
diversion, and some regions benefit slightly in the
short run, for example, the euro area. The effect is
short-lived: As relative prices and sectoral demand
adjust, the impact on activity becomes uniformly
negative across countries. The effect builds over time
as tariffs weigh on capital accumulation. Tariffs reduce
world GDP by 0.6 percent by 2027 and by 1 percent
in the long term. There is a small increase in global
inflation of about 10 basis points in 2025–26, as
the direct effect from higher tariffs is offset by the
disinflationary effect from reduced activity.5 Inflation
falls below the reference forecast after that, including
inflation in the United States.
The increase in global uncertainty layer reduces
global investment by close to 2 percent in 2025 and
3 percent in 2026, relative to the reference forecast.
Global consumption also decreases over 2025–27.
The overall impact on global output from this layer is
closer to –0.5 percent of that in reference forecast in
2025 and –0.8 percent in 2026. The layer contributes
a moderate decrease in global inflation and policy
rates of close to 20 basis points by 2026. The tighter
financial conditions layer subtracts 0.5 percent from
global GDP in 2025, with all regions being affected,
from both the domestic tightening and international
spillovers.
The combined effect of the layers in scenario A is a
decrease in global GDP of about 1.3 percent by 2025
and 1.9 percent by 2026, relative to the reference
forecast. All regions see a sizable decline in activity
over the WEO horizon and in the long term, with the
long-term impact reflecting tariff distortions and lower
productivity. The decrease in global activity is disinflationary, with global headline inflation and policy rates
falling by close to 40 basis points by 2027. Inflation
and policy rates are initially flat in the United States
but fall below those in the reference forecast after
2026. The current account balance decreases in the
United States (the deficit worsens relative to the

in Box 1.2. The effect depends on responses of exchange rates,
wages, and firms’ markups.

reference forecast) and increases in China and the rest
of the world.
In scenario B, the lower US government debt layer
reduces US debt by 25 percent of GDP over the long
term, increasing fiscal sustainability. US fiscal reforms
have a positive short-run effect on US activity, with
GDP increasing by 0.2 percent in 2025–26. Inflation
net of tax effects is slightly higher than that in the
reference forecast, as are policy rates. The reduction in
US public debt leads to a gradual decline in US and
global real interest rates, which decrease by 10 basis
points in the long run. Beyond the WEO horizon,
the long-run effect is positive for both US and world
GDP, by 0.4 and 0.2 percent relative to the reference
forecast, respectively. The United States also experiences an increase in its current account balance (lower
deficits than in the reference forecast).
The higher public spending in Europe layer provides a sizable boost to the euro area, raising GDP
by up to 1.3 percent by 2026, relative to that in the
reference forecast. Inflation increases by more than
20 basis points over the WEO horizon, with the euro
area policy rate increasing by about 50 basis points.
The current account balance decreases (lower surplus
than in the reference forecast). The buildup in public
capital raises productivity and potential output in the
euro area permanently. Spillovers to other regions are
positive but small.
The productivity gains and rebalancing in China
layer raises that country’s GDP by about 1 percent by
2026, relative to that in the reference forecast; about
one-third of the increase is the result of improved
sentiment. The reduction in the saving rate adds to
domestic demand, and potential output increases
gradually to 2 percent above the current reference
forecast, with a positive net effect on inflation that
reaches about 20 basis points by 2030. China’s current
account decreases considerably (lower surplus relative
to that in the reference forecast).
Finally, the combined effect of the layers in scenario
B is an increase in global output of about 0.4 percent
by 2026 (0.8 percent in the long term) and an increase
in global inflation of about 15 basis points.

Box 1.2. The Global Effects of Recent Trade Policy Actions: Insights from Multiple Models
This box analyzes the macroeconomic implications of recent tariff announcements included in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) reference forecast
and provides a range of possible outcomes regarding
their macroeconomic impact. The effects of tariffs are
complex, operating through different channels that
may not be sufficiently captured by a single model. The
analysis here draws on three models: the IMF’s Global
Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model and
two trade models based on Caliendo and Parro (2015;
hereafter “CP”) and Caliendo, Feenstra, Romalis, and
Taylor (2023; hereafter “CFRT”).1 The impacts on
global activity are negative and larger for countries experiencing higher tariff increases or more directly exposed.
The effects on inflation, and to some extent exchange
rates, are uncertain and depend on various factors. This
assessment for activity should be considered a lower
bound. The impact on inflation could also be greater
than expected. Notably, further escalation of trade measures beyond those discussed in this box and prolonged
uncertainty about future tariffs amplify the negative
macroeconomic effects but are not considered here.2

Tariff Announcements Included in the
Model-Based Assessment
The box considers the set of tariff measures that were
implemented between February 1 and April 4, 2025.
These include unilateral tariff increases by the United
States. Some are country and region specific, such as
the April 2 tariffs levied in proportion to partners’
bilateral trade surpluses, with a minimum rate increase
of 10 percent. Other tariff increases are on specific
goods and commodities, such as steel and aluminum
and auto and auto parts. The combined measures
increase the effective overall tariff rate in the United
States by about 25 percentage points, ranging from
an average increase of about 15 percentage points for
Canada, the euro area, and Mexico to 27 percentage
points for an aggregate of Asian countries excluding
China and more than 50 percentage points for China.
Tariff responses by US trading partners are also
included here. Canada places a 25 percent tariff on
40 percent of imports of US goods. It is also assumed

to respond with one-to-one tariffs on imports of
US autos. In response to the April 2 tariffs, China
increases tariffs on all US imports by 34 percentage
points, in addition to earlier targeted measures aimed
at some energy, transport, and agricultural goods.
Overall, the countermeasures amount to an effective
tariff rate increase of about 5 percentage points on
total US goods exports.
The models. GIMF is a global dynamic model featuring capital accumulation, numerous rigidities, three
sectors, and global value chains. The version of GIMF
employed here has eight countries. CP and CFRT are
static models with rich country and sectoral structures
(160 countries and 12 sectors in the specification of
CP used here, 60 and 17, respectively, in this specification of CFRT) and detailed input-output linkages.
CP assumes constant returns to scale, whereas CFRT
features heterogeneous firms with increasing returns to
scale determining whether to produce and export.

Short-Term Effects
GIMF is used to assess the short-term dynamics
(one to three years).
Assumptions. Endogenous monetary policy responses
are assumed, with fully floating exchange rates in
Canada, the euro area, Mexico, the United States,
and other regions. The yuan-to-dollar exchange rate is
assumed to be managed through capital flow measures, which allows some exchange rate adjustment in
China but by less than what would be implied by a
fully floating regime. Tariff revenues are used to reduce
debt over the first 30 years; in the long term they are
rebated to households.
Along with the standard specification of GIMF, the
short-term analysis considers two additional specifications (“versions”) that vary along the following
dimensions:
• US dollar invoicing of global trade. In the first specification, exporters charge for their wares in local
currency. An alternative version assumes instead that
about half of global trade is denominated in dollars.
This assumption leads to inflationary pressures in
other countries when the US dollar appreciates.
• US inflation. The initial assumption is that tariffs
are perceived as permanent (resulting in a large
appreciation of the dollar) and that US firms partly
absorb the resulting increase in import costs through
lower margins. In this alternative version, tariffs are
expected to be removed after several years (limiting
dollar appreciation), and US firms are assumed to

CHAPTER 1

GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES

Box 1.2 (continued)
fully pass higher import costs through to consumers.
Both assumptions cause the tariff increases to result
in higher inflationary pressures in the United States.
Figure 1.2.1 shows the impact across the three versions of GIMF (the standard specification plus the two
alternative versions) for bilateral real exchange rates
with respect to the United States, for inflation, and
for GDP. Results are shown in deviations from a no-­
tariff baseline for the world, the United States, China,
Canada and Mexico combined (CMX in the figure),
the euro area, and other Asian countries.
Currencies. Higher tariffs lead to a depreciation of
currencies with respect to the dollar (Figure 1.2.1,
panel 1). The euro area and Other Asia experience
the largest depreciations. The yuan depreciates by
less relative to others on account of the exchange rate
management assumption. Exchange rate movements
are considerably smaller if tariff increases are perceived
as temporary, about one-third the size relative to the
version of the model in which tariffs are perceived as
permanent.
Inflation. The impact on inflation is uncertain
(Figure 1.2.1, panel 2). In the first version, the effect is
limited, except in China, which experiences a decrease
of about 60 basis points in 2026 because of the managed exchange rate. Inflationary effects in the United
States are offset by the appreciation of the dollar and
some decline in markups. When tariffs are perceived
to be temporary and import costs are fully passed on,
US inflation increases by close to 50 basis points in
2025. The impact on inflation outside the United
States is instead larger if the dollar plays a central role
in the pricing of global trade, as the appreciation of
the dollar raises production costs globally.
Activity. Tariffs have a large negative impact on
global activity. The effect is largest for Canada and
Mexico, China, and the United States (Figure 1.2.1,
panel 3). The impact on China also reflects a less-thanfull adjustment of the exchange rate. The negative
impact on the United States is amplified in the version
of GIMF in which tariffs are perceived to be temporary and import costs are fully passed on, because the
resulting increase in inflation leads to a tightening of
monetary policy. The euro area and Other Asia benefit
slightly in the short run from trade diversion, but

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Box 1.2 (continued)
two trade models, despite each model emphasizing
different channels.
Output. Tariffs generate global long-term output losses across all models (Table 1.2.1, panel 2).
Canada and Mexico, China, and the United States
are the most affected. The negative impact on the
US is similar across GIMF (which captures well
changes in the capital stock) and CFRT (which
captures productivity losses due to misallocation). In
GIMF, lower levels of capital accumulation weaken
potential output; in CFRT, a reduction in market
access prompts some firms to stop exporting, and less
productive firms enter in import-competing sectors.
The effect on the United States is smallest in CP, as
relative to CFRT it does not account for productivity
losses due to productive firms exiting. The impact
on other regions varies across models, with GIMF
showing large negative effects for the euro area and
Other Asia, while trade models show relatively small
effects for those regions. This is because of greater
trade reallocation in the latter models, reflecting the
larger elasticities of substitution, which create scope
for countries less directly exposed, or facing smaller
tariffs, to benefit from the reconfiguration of global
trade. In GIMF, all countries are instead affected by
tariff-induced distortions along global supply chains,
which also explains why the negative impact on global
output is greater. More generally, the combined effects
from lower capital accumulation (captured by GIMF),
sectoral misallocation (captured by the trade models),
and prolonged trade policy uncertainty (not included
in the simulations) would compound the losses for
each region and could well offset any positive impact
from trade reallocation.

the effect depends on the currency used for invoicing
global trade. Under dollar invoicing, the appreciation
of the dollar weighs on global external demand, and
other regions experience large losses as well. The world
economy sees a negative hit to activity that ranges
between 0.4 and 1 percent of world GDP by 2027.

Medium- to Long-Term Effects
All three models (GIMF, CP, and CFRT) are used
to assess medium- to long-term impact (10 years),
under the assumption that tariffs are permanent.
Channels. The first trade model (CP) emphasizes
losses because tariffs move resources inefficiently across
sectors. Losses in the second model (CFRT) tend to be
larger because tariffs reduce access to foreign markets
by the most productive firms, while leading to entry
of less productive firms domestically. The third model
(GIMF) emphasizes lower levels of capital accumulation from tariff-related distortions. In all models,
tariffs imposed by large countries can create favorable
terms-of-trade effects. Finally, results depend crucially
on the ease with which importers can substitute across
different exporters (trade elasticities) and across foreign
and domestic producers (macro elasticities). Elasticities
are greater in the two trade models than in GIMF.
Trade. Tariffs permanently reduce global trade
and reallocate flows across countries (Table 1.2.1,
panel 1). Canada, Mexico, China, and especially the
United States see the largest declines in exports, in the
latter country due in large part to the long-term real
appreciation of the US dollar. Although China sees the
largest tariff increase, the decline in China’s exports
is mitigated by export diversion to other markets.
Magnitudes are broadly similar across GIMF and the

SpecialDevelopments
Feature Head and the
Impact of AI on Energy Demand
Primary commodity prices increased 1.9 percent between
August 2024 and March 2025, with the rise driven by
natural gas, precious metals, and beverage prices. In oil
markets, prices fell amid concerns that a trade war could
dampen global demand, adding to downward pressure
from robust oil production growth outside OPEC+
(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus
selected nonmember countries, including Russia) and
the unwinding of OPEC+ supply cuts. With the notable
exception of gold prices, which continued to soar owing
to geopolitical uncertainty, and prices of some staples like
wheat, most commodity prices have dropped since the
announcement of additional tariffs by the US administration on April 2. This Special Feature also analyzes the
impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on energy demand.

Commodity Market Developments
Oil prices declined 9.7 percent between August 2024
and March 2025 as trade war fears, strong non-OPEC+
supply growth, and the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts more
than offset lingering supply risks. Oil prices then plummeted in early April amid escalating trade tensions,
adding to an already-bearish outlook. This latest catalyst
compounded weak fundamentals, with supply growth
expected to likely outpace tepid global demand growth
through 2025 and 2026. Demand concerns were exacerbated by sluggish Chinese demand, partly dented by the
rising penetration of electric vehicles (EVs).
In this context, OPEC+ policy will be pivotal:
Facing pressure to roll back its deep and sustained cuts,
OPEC+ has decided to start gradually unwinding them
despite a broader environment of falling prices. The
harshest sanctions on Russia to date (imposed on January 10, 2025) have not materially disrupted oil flows.
Russian oil, exported primarily to China and India, has
traded at a $5–$15 discount to Brent. Futures markets
indicate that oil prices will average $66.9 per barrel in
2025, a 15.5 percent decline, before falling to $62.4 in
2026 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 2). Risks to this outlook are

balanced. Upside price risks from potential disruptions
in oil supply from countries subject to sanctions or a
de-escalation of trade barriers are offset by the possibility of a further escalation in the trade war and additional increases in OPEC+’s production schedule.
Natural gas prices reversed course in the first week of
April, beginning to decline alongside oil prices after a
six-month period of gains. Title Transfer Facility (TTF)
trading hub prices in Europe rose 7.7 percent between
August 2024 and March 2025 to $13.1 a million British
thermal units (MMBtu). This was above the historical
average but well below the 2022 peak. Among other factors, a cold snap and various supply disruptions, including a halt of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine at
the beginning of January 2025, explained the upward
trend. Similarly, harsh weather and a surge in demand
for gas exports led to a doubling in Henry Hub prices.
International Monetary Fund | April 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Weak demand from China, in contrast, kept Asian
liquefied natural gas prices almost constant over the same
period. Following the April 2 tariff announcement, gas
prices reversed course, with concerns about future energy
demand pushing gas prices down across the board. As of
April 4, futures markets suggested that TTF prices will
average $12.5 a MMBtu in 2025, steadily decreasing to
$7.8 a MMBtu in 2030. Henry Hub prices are expected
to decline from $4.0 a MMBtu in 2025 to $3.3 a
MMBtu in 2030. Risks to this outlook are balanced.
Metals prices rose amid safe-haven demand and supply
disruptions until the end of March, but things changed
abruptly on April 2. The IMF’s metals price index
increased by 11.2 percent between August 2024 and
March 2025 (Figure 1.SF.1, panel 1), with the rise
driven mainly by gold, aluminum, and copper prices.
Among base metals, aluminum (12.7 percent) and copper prices (8.4 percent) increased the most because of
supply concerns. Both metals also faced demand pressures from front-loading ahead of tariffs. Like those for
energy, industrial metals prices dropped abruptly in the
first week of April as trade tensions escalated. Futures
markets now predict a downturn in prices for base
metals, with price declines of 5.7, 4.5 and 14.3 percent
for aluminum, copper, and iron ore, respectively, by
the end of 2026. This stands in contrast to what has
taken place regarding prices for precious metals: Gold
prices have repeatedly set new records amid policy
and geopolitical uncertainty, recently surpassing their
historical high at $3,000 per ounce.
Agricultural commodity prices increased as a result
of adverse weather. Between August 2024 and March
2025, the IMF’s food and beverages price index
increased by 3.6 percent, with the rise driven by
higher beverage prices. Cereal prices increased modestly, by 0.6 percent, as concerns over crop conditions
for wheat and corn subsided. Coffee prices jumped
33.8 percent, with the IMF coffee index reaching
historic highs in February because of weather-related
supply concerns in Brazil. Meanwhile, rice prices fell
26.0 percent as crop conditions improved in India
and other parts of Asia. New trade barriers imposed in
April had heterogeneous effects on agricultural prices.
The price of income-elastic (coffee) and trade-sensitive
(soybeans) crops have declined sharply, whereas prices
for staples like corn and wheat are so far less affected.
Upside risks stem from trade disruptions and adverse
weather; larger-than-expected harvests, trade war
intensification, and broader uncertainty are the main
downside risks.

Power Hungry: How AI Will Drive
Energy Demand
The rapid development and adoption of generative
AI models, including large language models, require
building more data centers that consume vast amounts
of electricity. Large language models’ costs have two
main components: a large fixed cost for training the
models and variable costs for operating and responding
to user prompts.1 Because substantial computational
resources are required during both stages, electricity
consumption represents a critical input for companies
delivering AI services. In northern Virginia, which
features the largest concentration of data centers in the
world, the square footage of server-filled warehouses
is now roughly equivalent to the floor space of eight
Empire State Buildings (Cushman & Wakefield 2024).
Using a multicountry computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, IMF-ENV (Chateau and others
2025), this Special Feature seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How fast have sectors involved in the
development and delivery of AI-related services grown
in recent years, and what has happened to their electricity consumption? (2) How does the projected electricity
demand from AI by 2030 compare with other drivers
of demand, such as EVs? (3) What is the impact on
energy prices and the mix of electricity sources under
alternative policy scenarios? (4) What will be the impact
of data centers’ growth on carbon emissions?

The Growing Macroeconomic Relevance of
AI-Producing Sectors
In the US, AI-producing sectors’ value added
quadrupled from $278 billion (in constant 2017
dollars) to $1.13 trillion between 2010 and 2023, a
rate much faster than those for private nonfarm and
manufacturing value added. As a result, these sectors’
share in total US GDP increased from 2.4 percent in
2013 to 3.5 percent in 2023, with the data-processing
sector nearly doubling its share in the same period.
Meanwhile, the share of manufacturing declined by
1.5 percentage points (Figure 1.SF.2, panel 1). This
fast growth of AI-producing sectors was driven by
remarkable gains in labor productivity, with value
added per employee in the data-processing sector
1Large fixed costs create economies of scale that concentrate AI
development among a few large players (Korinek and Vipra 2024),
although this pool has expanded recently as more variation in the
cost structure of large language models has emerged.

growing about four times faster than that in the whole
economy over the past 10 years (see Online Annex
Figure 1.1.2, panel 1 in Online Annex 1.1).2 This
productivity growth was largely the result of elevated
investment in physical capital and the complementarity of intermediate inputs, contrary to what was the
case in computer systems design, in which labor and
total factor productivity (TFP) contributed significantly to output growth (Figure 1.SF.2, panel 2).
Hence, the high output per employee in data centers,
compared with that in other sectors, is the result
of rapid capital accumulation, which has increased
energy consumption as an intermediate input.

AI’s Demand for Electricity
Electricity costs make up 13–15 percent of total
costs for data center companies, whereas they account

for only 0.8–1.5 percent for semiconductor firms and
AI service companies. However, the latter have almost
doubled the share of electricity costs in their total costs
in less than five years (see Online Annex Figure 1.1.3
in Online Annex 1.1). As these companies integrate
vertically by building, operating, and leasing their own
data centers, that share will likely continue to grow.
The broader implications for global electricity
consumption are substantial. Worldwide electricity
consumption from data centers and AI is estimated to
have reached 400–500 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023,
more than double the level in 2015 (OPEC 2024). For
the United States, where growth is the fastest, electricity demand from data centers is expected to increase
from 178 TWh in 2024 to 606 TWh in 2030 under
a medium-demand scenario (McKinsey & Company
2024a). By 2030, AI-driven global electricity consumption could hit 1,500 TWh, conceivably making
its level comparable to that of India’s current total
electricity consumption, the third highest in the world.
This projected electricity demand from AI by 2030 is
about 1.5 times higher than expected demand from
EVs, another emerging source of electricity demand
(Figure 1.SF.3).
Recent developments in the AI industry have
increased uncertainty about its future compute and
energy demands. Companies such as DeepSeek are

achieving breakthroughs in algorithmic efficiency
that may lower the computational costs of AI models faster than previously anticipated. However, these
efficiency gains may be counterbalanced by greater use
of compute by companies pursuing better-performing models (Hoffmann and others 2022). Adding to
this complexity is the recent emergence of reasoning
models—which require more compute in their deployment—and possibly greater AI use driven by lower
costs and availability of open-source models.

The Effects of Increased Demand for Electricity
In the IMF-ENV model, the impact of AI is
captured by an increase in information technology
(IT) sectors’ TFP in China, the United States, and
Europe to match the expected increase in data center
power demand between 2025 and 2030 (see Online
Annex Table 1.1.1. in Online Annex 1.1). This growth
is projected at constant annual rates of 22, 13, and
10 percent, respectively (JP Morgan 2024; McKinsey
& Company 2024a, 2024b).
Three scenarios are simulated here: (1) a baseline
scenario, which excludes the AI-related TFP shock
but reflects energy and emissions projections consistent with policies introduced through 2024; (2) an AI
scenario under current energy policies, which models the
AI-related TFP shock, assuming that the composition
of electricity generation remains identical to that in the
baseline scenario; and (3) an AI scenario under alternative energy policies, under which the share of renewables
in total electricity generation is aligned with regions’
long-term strategies using feed-in tariffs for renewables,
though in practice policy choices will be guided by
countries’ preferences.3 Results for both AI scenarios
are reported as deviations from the baseline scenario,
unless stated otherwise.
The AI shock increases electricity consumption
by the IT sector, and power producers are expected
to expand generation. The composition of electricity
generation by technologies varies across countries and
is based on their relative production costs and current
policies. By 2030, in the AI scenario under current
energy policies, total electricity supply increases by
3AI expansion relies on electricity growth, so countries’ energy

policies should focus on supply. Different supply-side policies affect
prices, GDP, and revenue (Chateau, Jaumotte, and Schwerhoff
2024). Feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind are
simulated owing to their historical inclusion in policy packages and
because these renewables are cost competitive with fossil fuels in
these regions (IRENA 2024).

38

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

8 percent in the United States (525 TWh), 3 percent
in Europe (145 TWh), and 2 percent in China
(237 TWh) relative to the baseline scenario. In the AI
scenario under alternative energy policies, the increase
in total electricity supply is kept the same, but its
composition shifts in favor of renewables. In China,
the United States, and Europe, generation from solar
and wind sources offsets about 166 TWh, 58 TWh,
and 35 TWh of generation, respectively, from other
sources, including largely coal power in China and
natural gas in the US (Figure 1.SF.4, panel 1).
In both scenarios, the rising marginal costs of
electricity supply mean that the increase in generation
is less than proportional to economy-wide demand
growth, which drives electricity prices up. At the
same time, strong commitment of major AI players to
resolving medium-term power supply rigidities4 could
lead to a smaller increase in electricity prices. In this
case, the surge would be 0.9 percent in the United
States, 0.45 percent in Europe, and 0.35 percent in
China under current energy policies (Figure 1.SF.4,
panel 2). However, material pressure on prices would
be added if the renewables scale-up slows from recent
trends and if further investments are not made in
transmission and distribution capacities (relative to
those in the baseline). The price increase in the AI scenario under current energy policies could escalate up to
5.3 percent in China, 8.6 percent in the United States,
and 3.6 percent in Europe by 2030 (Figure 1.SF.4,
panel 2), adding to price pressures coming from many
other sources.5
In addition, without further investments in transmission and distribution, support for the expansion of
the AI sector would require redirecting electricity from
other economic activities. Such a shift would pose
significant challenges, especially for energy-intensive
manufacturing sectors. In the United States, for example, annual growth in the value added of these sectors
would fall by an average of 0.3 percentage point
compared with that in the baseline scenario, reducing
4Public investments are being made in the United States for
upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure to meet
rising electricity demand. Innovative solutions like power coupling
(Engel, Posner, and Varadarajan 2025) and small modular nuclear
reactors could offer flexibility, making constraints less restrictive than
expected. Most new nuclear capacity in the United States is expected
online no earlier than the early 2030s.
5Chandramowli and others (2024) estimate a 19 percent rise in US
wholesale electricity prices from 2025 to 2028 because of increased
demand driven not only by data centers, but also by electrification
of buildings and transportation, battery and fuel cell manufacturing,
AI, and cryptocurrency mining.

annual GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point. The electricity price increase is more muted in the AI scenario
under alternative energy policies owing to feed-in tariffs
on solar and wind. The tariffs reduce the generation
price of these technologies, which have relatively low
production costs and a higher share in total electricity
generation compared with those in the AI scenario
under current energy policies.
In both AI scenarios, global and regional greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions increase because of the increased
energy demand resulting from the expanded IT sector
and its spillovers to the economy. In the AI scenario
under current energy policies, the 2030 increase is 5.5,
3.7, and 1.2 percent in the US, Europe, and China,
respectively, with a global average increase of 1.2 percent
(Figure 1.SF.5). In cumulative terms, this translates
into a global GHG emissions increase of 1.7 gigatons
(Gt) between 2025 and 2030, which is similar to Italy’s
energy-related GHG emissions over a five-year period.
Notably, in the AI scenario under alternative energy
policies, even a modest decarbonization of the power

sector limits the total cumulative global GHG emissions
increase to 1.3 Gt by 2030, which is 24 percent less
than in the AI scenario under current energy policies.6
In the AI scenario under current energy policies, the
AI shock raises the average annual growth rate of
global GDP by 0.5 percentage point between 2025
and 2030, in line with previous IMF estimates ranging
between 0.1 percentage point and 0.8 percentage point
(April 2024 World Economic Outlook). The impact is
greater in countries where the projected growth rate
of the IT sector and its relative importance in the
economy are higher. In the AI scenario under alternative
energy policies, these gains are slightly reduced because
of the feed-in tariff polices. The total fiscal costs of
these tariffs range from 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent
of GDP across countries and are financed through
increased lump-sum taxes, which slightly reduce household consumption. However, the growth benefits from
AI expansion far outweigh these costs, resulting in similar average annual GDP growth across both scenarios.
In summary, although the AI-induced expansion
of the IT sector is expected to raise global GDP, the
development also comes at the cost of higher carbon
emissions. Drawing on a median social cost of carbon
6This estimate is conservative compared with that of Stern and
Romani (2025), who project that AI’s energy demand could contribute between 0.4 and 1.6 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent annually
by 2035.

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

estimate of $39 per ton—based on 147 published
studies with more than 1,800 estimates (Moore and
others 2024)—the additional social cost of 1.3 to
1.7 Gt of carbon-dioxide-equivalent emissions is
about $50.7 billion to $66.3 billion, or 1.3 percent
to 1.7 percent of the AI-driven increase in real world
GDP between 2025 and 2030.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
As AI technologies continue to evolve and proliferate, demand for computational power and electricity
is poised for a significant surge. Despite challenges
related to higher electricity prices and GHG emissions,
the gains to global GDP from AI are likely to outweigh the costs of the additional emissions. The economic benefits, however, may not be evenly distributed
across countries and among different groups within
societies, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.
Increasing electricity demand from the IT sector
will stimulate overall supply, which—if sufficiently

40

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

responsive—will lead to a small increase in electricity
prices. More sluggish supply responses will lead to
much stronger price surges. In the United States, the
country with the largest expected surge in electricity
demand, AI expansion alone could increase electricity
prices by up to 9 percent, adding to price pressures
coming from many other sources.
In addition, under current energy policies, the
AI-driven rise in electricity demand could add 1.7
Gt in global greenhouse gas emissions between 2025
and 2030, an amount similar to Italy’s energy-related
GHG emissions over a five-year period. The social cost
of these extra emissions is minor compared with the
expected economic gains from AI, yet it still adds to
the worrying buildup of worldwide emissions.
Demand for computing and electricity from AI
service producers is subject to wide uncertainty, which
may delay energy investments, causing underinvestment and higher prices. Policymakers and businesses
must work together to ensure AI achieves its full
potential, while minimizing societal costs.

THE RISE OF THE SILVER ECONOMY:
GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION AGING

As the global population ages, economies worldwide face
significant demographic shifts with far-reaching implications. This chapter explores the rise of the “silver economy,”
focusing on three key areas: the extent of healthy aging
and its impact on labor markets, the broader economic
implications of demographic changes, and the role of
targeted policies in mitigating the adverse effects of aging.
The analysis reveals that although population aging poses
challenges such as slower growth and increased fiscal
pressures, healthier aging trends offer a silver lining by
boosting labor force participation, extending working
lives, and enhancing productivity. The chapter underscores
the importance of policies that support healthy aging,
increase labor force participation among older individuals, and close gender gaps in the workforce. By leveraging
strategies related to these policies, countries can harness
the potential of the silver economy to boost growth and
rebuild fiscal buffers amid demographic headwinds.

Introduction
Unprecedented demographic changes expected
throughout this century are creating increasingly
pressing issues for all countries to navigate. Global
population growth will slow from 1.1 percent per year
before the COVID-19 pandemic to basically zero in
2080–2100 (Figure 2.1). An ongoing decline in fertility and an increase in longevity are expected to bring
sharp changes in the age structure of economies, with
the average age of the world’s population projected to
increase by 11 years between 2020 and the end of the
century. These forces are driving the rise of the “silver
economy,” as the share of the older population—
ages 65 and older—is increasing rapidly throughout
the world, with far-reaching implications for economies and societies.
The authors of this chapter are Bertrand Gruss (co-lead), Eric
Huang, Andresa Lagerborg, Diaa Noureldin (co-lead), and Galip
Kemal Ozhan, with support from Pedro de Barros Gagliardi and
Ziyan Han. Adrien Auclert, Hannes Malmberg, and Matthew Rognlie
were external consultants. The chapter benefited from comments by
Andrew Scott and internal seminar participants and reviewers.

Population aging has often been linked to gloomy
prospects for economic growth and public finances.
The fall in the proportion of working-age individuals
may depress labor supply and output growth (Gagnon,
Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; Maestas, Mullen,
and Powell 2023). Slower population growth can
also lead to fewer ideas and less innovation, and thus
slower productivity growth (Aksoy and others 2019;
Jones 2022). A higher dependency ratio, wherein
fewer workers support more retirees, can strain public
pension systems and increase health care spending
(Lee 2016).
However, individuals are not only living for longer
but generally also aging in better health (Scott 2021,
2023; Kotschy and Bloom 2023). Globally, life
expectancy has increased by about 4½ years over the
past two decades. Importantly, healthy life expectancy
has increased at a similar pace, with additional years
largely free from chronic illnesses. Recent studies have
documented significant improvements in the physical
and cognitive abilities of individuals over the age of
50 in some advanced economies, though with notable
heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups (Freedman
and others 2013; Abeliansky and Strulik 2019; Old
and Scott 2023). Healthier aging could thus continue
to boost labor supply by extending working lives and
enhancing older workers’ productivity, offering a bright
spot amid the rise of the silver economy.
Against this backdrop, this chapter pursues the
following intertwined objectives: (1) assessing the
extent to which cohorts are aging in better health and
its impact on labor market outcomes, (2) evaluating
the global economic implications of demographic
shifts and healthy-aging trends, and (3) exploring how
targeted policies can help mitigate the negative effects
of population aging.
To achieve these objectives, the chapter seeks to
answer the following questions:
• Global demographic transition: How have demographic trends evolved globally? How fast and
uneven is the pace of aging across different
countries?

• Healthy aging: Is there evidence that individuals
in later-born cohorts are healthier than those in
earlier-born cohorts at the same age? How do
healthy-aging trends differ across countries and
socioeconomic groups? Has healthy aging increased
the labor market attachment and productivity of
older individuals?
• Economic implications of global population aging:
What are the likely implications of population
aging for growth, interest rates, public finances, and
external balances? How do these implications differ
across countries given uneven demographic trends?
To what extent can longer and more productive
working lives as a result of healthy aging offset the
economic and fiscal challenges of population aging?
• The role of policies: How can policies help generate
growth tailwinds to mitigate the adverse economic
impacts of demographic transitions?
To answer these questions, the chapter first relies
on microsurvey data from approximately 1 million
individuals from 29 advanced and 12 emerging market
economies over 2000–22 to establish the extent of
healthy-aging trends and their association with labor
market outcomes. It then employs a multicountry,
overlapping-generations general equilibrium model covering 69 economies—representing about two-thirds of
global output and the world’s population—to assess the
economic implications of global aging through the end

50

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

of the century. After baseline projections under current
policies are established, the model is used to assess the
potential impact of targeted progrowth policies to cushion against the growth and fiscal implications of aging.
The chapter’s main findings are as follows:
• Economies worldwide are aging rapidly as a result of
declining fertility and rising life expectancy, with the
pace of aging varying significantly across regions. No
longer confined to advanced economies, aging is
accelerating in many emerging market and middle-income economies. Meanwhile, the window for
reaping demographic dividends in younger, low-income countries is gradually closing.
• In many countries, people not only are living longer but
are also aging in better health, which is associated with
longer and more productive working lives. Alongside
increases in longevity, the functional capacity of
older individuals has improved over time. More
recent cohorts of older individuals are physically
stronger and cognitively abler than earlier cohorts at
the same age. Notably, when cognitive capacities are
the focus, “the 70s are the new 50s”: Data from a
sample of 41 advanced and emerging market economies indicate that, on average, a person who was 70
in 2022 had the same cognitive ability as a 53-yearold in 2000. Over the course of a decade, this pace
of improvement in cognitive abilities is associated
with an increase of approximately 20 percentage
points in the likelihood that individuals remain
engaged in the labor market, either by working or
actively seeking employment, along with an increase
of about six hours in average weekly hours worked
and a 30 percent rise in labor earnings, conditional
on being employed.
• Although healthy aging will partly offset the negative
impact of demographic headwinds, the growth of
global output will slow significantly through the 21st
century, and many countries will need sizable efforts
to stabilize public-debt-to-GDP ratios. Ongoing
increases in the labor supply and improvements in
the human capital of older individuals because of
healthy aging are expected to contribute about 0.4
percentage point annually to global GDP growth
over 2025–50. Despite this tailwind, average global
annual output growth under current policies is projected to decline by 1.1 percentage points during
the same period, compared with the 2016–18
average. Demographic trends alone are expected
to account for almost three-fourths of this decline.
Lower growth, combined with an increasing share

CHAPTER 2

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

of older individuals with higher accumulated
savings in large economies, is projected to exert
downward pressure on interest rates. Still, most
countries are likely to face a worse interest-growth
differential than in the recent past, and many will
need higher primary balances than they registered
in 2016–18 to keep debt ratios stable from 2030
onward. Uneven demographic trends are also likely
to exert widening pressure on external global positions through the end of the century.
• A multifaceted policy approach can increase labor
supply, boost growth, and ease fiscal pressures amid
global population aging. Lifelong policies to support
the human capital of workers in late adulthood (that
is, people who are between age 50 and retirement
age), including health promotion and prevention
measures, can significantly counter the effect of
population aging on growth. In addition, raising
labor force participation among the 65-and-older
age group—by gradually increasing the effective
retirement age in line with improvements in life
expectancy—and closing gender gaps where they
remain large would provide significant growth
tailwinds in many countries. A combination of labor
supply policies could boost global annual output
growth by about 0.6 percentage point over the next
25 years, offsetting almost three-fourths of the drag
from demographics during that period. The fiscal
dividends from progrowth policies would enable
many countries to rebuild buffers and create space
for critical spending needs. Expanding access to
international financial markets through credit and
capital market reforms, alongside stronger governance and institutions, would allow younger, low-income countries to reap demographic dividends
before the window for doing so closes and offset
potential losses from migration outflows to older,
labor-scarce economies.
The chapter examines the implications of population aging for growth, interest rates, external balances,
and public finances but does not cover all relevant
aspects. Notably, it abstracts from shifts in consumer
demand and sectoral reallocations driven by aging, as
well as the implications for the financial sector, house
prices, and urbanization. The analysis also abstracts
from endogenous technological responses to aging—
such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI)—
which could mitigate some of the negative growth
effects.

Uneven Pace of Global Population Aging
Advancements in health care, public health measures, and improvements in living standards in past
decades have contributed to significant declines in
mortality rates across the world. Lower mortality rates
in middle and old age have resulted in significant
increases in life expectancy and longevity. These trends,
together with falling birth rates, are leading to significant changes in the age structure of economies.
Under current demographic projections, economies around the world are progressively crossing their
“demographic turning point”—the year when the share
of the working-age population in their total population begins to decline—typically marking a transition
from a demographic dividend to a demographic drag
(Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla 2003). By 2035, all
advanced economies and the largest emerging markets
will have crossed this threshold (Figure 2.2, panel 1).
By 2070, most low-income countries will have experienced similar shifts.
At the same time, increased longevity is contributing to the rise of the silver economy, because the
share of the older population is projected to increase
rapidly (Figure 2.2, panel 2). Although the rise in
the share of older individuals is steepest in the “early
agers”—including the largest advanced economies and
emerging markets in Europe and Asia—the relatively
younger Latin American economies, as well as the
world’s youngest regions (Africa and the Middle East),
will also experience a sharp rise in the share of the
older population.
Aging is no longer a concern limited to advanced
economies; it is a universal trend whose implications
all countries will navigate throughout this century. And
the window for low-income countries to reap demographic dividends is gradually closing.

Healthy Aging and Implications for
Labor Markets
Because longevity is a key driver of changes in the
age structure of economies, an important question is
whether individuals are aging in better health. Is there
evidence that the functional ability of older individuals
has been increasing over time? How broad-based are
these gains across different economies? And what are
the implications for labor markets?
To tackle these questions, this section uses microdata from surveys of individuals ages 50 and above,

The surveys ask for information on various dimensions
of physical, cognitive, and mental health, as well as the
incidence of 18 chronic diseases (for example, arthritis, heart conditions, diabetes, cancer, psychological
disorders) and individuals’ health behaviors (for example, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity,
obesity). Among measured health indicators are physical

status, various aspects of physical functionality (ease of
performing activities of daily living, such as dressing
and eating, and instrumental activities of daily living,
such as managing money and shopping for groceries; frequency of pain; and hearing ability), and a
composite measure of psychological well-being. Not
surprisingly, all these indicators capturing the functional capacity of individuals tend to decline with age
(Online Annex Figure 2.2.2). However, a key question
is whether, for a given age, they have been improving
across cohorts.

Healthy Aging amid Persistent Heterogeneity
Are successive generations experiencing better
health at older ages, consistent with the concept of
healthy aging? The findings indicate a broad-based
healthy-aging phenomenon, as evidenced by a range of
physical, cognitive, and mental health indicators showing improvement over time when other covariates are
controlled for (Figure 2.3). Healthy-aging gains appear
to be most prominent in regard to cognitive functions.
The estimated trend for the first principal component
of cognitive indicators suggests that, on average and
after individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics (such as
age, gender, education, and wealth) and country fixed
effects are controlled for, the cognitive abilities of a

person aged 70 in 2022 are comparable to those of a
person who was 53 in 2000. The trend is also positive
and statistically significant, albeit somewhat weaker, in
regard to other health measures and for a composite
“frailty” health index (like the one used in Abeliansky
and Strulik 2019; Abeliansky, Erel, and Strulik 2020;
Old and Scott 2023). On average, the frailty of a
70-year-old person in 2022 corresponded to that of a
person who was 56 in 2000 (Online Annex 2.2). The
fact that improvements in the area of cognitive skills
have been significant and large is particularly relevant
as there is evidence that people tend to work in less
physically demanding roles at the workplace as they
age (Online Annex Figure 2.2.7).
Although these trends are encouraging, another
important question is how broad-based these
healthy-aging gains have been across countries and
socioeconomic groups. A simple inspection of life
expectancy across countries does point to some global
convergence in longevity. First, average life expectancy
across countries has been gradually catching up to

the life expectancy frontier (Figure 2.4, panel 1; note
that setbacks in the 1960s and 2020s shown in the
figure were due to global pandemics). For instance,
Japan, Korea, and Singapore—among the countries
with the highest longevities today—had very different
life expectancies in the 1950s. Second, countries with
lower health-adjusted life expectancies—defined as the
average number of years that a person can expect to
live in good health—at the start of the 21st century
have experienced, on average, faster improvements
than other countries over the past two decades
(Figure 2.4, panel 2).
However, survey-based data reveal important
cross-country differences in the functional capacity
of older individuals. If cognitive indicators are the
focus, the analysis shows that although individuals’
cognitive health is positively associated with their
countries’ GDP per capita, there is notable variation
across countries (Figure 2.5). Among Nordic countries, for instance, Sweden has a higher cognitive
health score than Denmark and Finland. Meanwhile,
despite a comparable GDP per capita and higher
health care spending, the United States systematically
lags behind Nordic countries on measured health
indicators. Also, cognitive health scores of older

individuals from emerging market economies are
lower than those from advanced economies after individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics are controlled
for (Figure 2.6).
Within countries, health disparities are related
to socioeconomic characteristics. Average health
scores are significantly lower for individuals in
rural locations, individuals with at most primary
education, and lower-wealth households (Figure 2.6).
In turn, although faster improvements in healthy
aging in emerging markets (compared with advanced
economies) suggest some cross-country “catching
up,” the pace of health improvements across other
dimensions has been similar despite widely varying
initial conditions (Figure 2.7). This indicates that
existing socioeconomic health disparities—related
to gender, location, education, and wealth—have
persisted.2 Further analysis reveals that lifestyle
factors, such as levels of physical activity, body mass
2Similarly, Old and Scott (2023) find that frailty has decreased
over time in the United Kingdom, though at varying rates across
socioeconomic groups, with the wealthiest experiencing the largest

have declined over time in a sample of European countries, but
health inequalities have persisted. Abeliansky, Erel, and Strulik
(2020) find that the time trend of health improvements in the
United States is similar across regions and for men and women, but
significantly lower for African Americans compared with Caucasians.

index, and smoking, are significant determinants of
the functional capacity of older individuals after age
and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for
(Online Annex 2.2).
In summary, although there is some evidence of
cross-country convergence, notable disparities in the
physical and cognitive capabilities of older individuals
persist, both within and across countries. Strengthening health care quality and expanding access,
particularly for preventive care and for disadvantaged
groups, and providing incentives for healthy lifestyles
can help narrow these healthy-aging gaps. Singapore’s
remarkable increase in life expectancy, from 90th in
the world in 1950 to first in 2018, underscores the
variety of policies that can be effective, including
subsidizing healthier food options, regulating sugar
content in beverages, building widespread public
fitness centers, introducing automobile congestion
charges, and subsidizing housing in proximity to family to promote intergenerational social connections
(Buettner 2012).

3The identification strategy rests on the assumption that at least

some chronic diseases—those unexplained by individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics and health behaviors—occur randomly. Using
alternative approaches to identify health shocks, previous studies
have demonstrated that sudden changes in health can induce older
workers to reduce their labor supply or retire (Bound and others
1999; Riphahn 1999; Disney, Emmerson, and Wakefield 2006) and
force younger individuals into inactivity (García-Gómez and LópezNicolás 2006; García-Gómez, Jones, and Rice 2010), and that the
employment effects may persist over many years (García-Gómez and
others 2013).

individuals? To shed light on this, the analysis
investigates the effect of health indicators capturing the
functional capacity of older individuals on measures of
labor supply and labor earnings.
A simple regression analysis reveals that higher
scores on the health indicators are associated with
increased total labor earnings and labor productivity
(proxied by hourly earnings), as well as with positive employment outcomes along both the extensive
margin (labor force participation) and intensive
margin (hours worked); see Online Annex Table 2.2.3.
However, these associations may not necessarily reflect
causal relationships. Some studies have argued that
increasing the retirement age negatively affects health
outcomes, especially for those in low-status occupations (Barschkett and others 2022; Abeliansky and
Strulik 2023), in which case the estimated correlations between the two would need to be interpreted
as lower bounds. Others find that working longer
is beneficial for most people but negative for some,
especially those in low-quality jobs (Calvo 2006). In
addition, there could be unobserved drivers of both
health and labor market outcomes that would bias the
relationship between the two.
To address these concerns, the analysis here employs
an instrumental-variables approach that exploits
exogenous health shocks, proxied by the development
of chronic diseases.3 Given that smoking, poor
nutrition, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use
are key risk factors for most chronic diseases (Hacker
2024), the regression employed in the analysis controls for these lifestyle behaviors. The estimates remain
statistically significant and are quantitatively larger
than the simple correlations (Figure 2.8). In regard to
economic magnitude, the results imply that average
cognitive health gains observed for older-age individuals over a decade are associated with rises in labor
earnings and labor productivity by about 30 percent,
an increase in their likelihood of participating in the
labor force by about 20 percentage points, and higher
numbers of average weekly hours worked by about

six hours. In addition, better health is also associated
with later retirement, working more weeks per year,
and a lower probability of being unemployed, and
qualitatively similar relationships hold for other health
indicators (Online Annex Table 2.2.4).4
Although healthy-aging gains have been comparable across age groups, the labor market impact of a
given improvement in health does vary with age. For
instance, the impact of better health on labor force
participation of individuals in their 50s is significantly
larger than that for individuals in their 60s and 70s
(Online Annex Figure 2.2.6). This suggests that even if
the functional capacity of older individuals improves,
other factors—such as skills obsolescence, pension
incentives, and age discrimination—can still constrain
their attachment to the labor market (Neumark, Burn,
and Button 2019; D’Albis 2023). However, evidence
4Qualitatively similar results are obtained when using an augmented inverse-probability-weighting approach, in which chronic
disease cases that are less predictable (that is, more random)—based
on individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics and health behaviors—
are given a higher weight, and when using the composite health
measure of frailty that averages various measured and self-reported
health indicators (Online Annex 2.2).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

of a general rise in the “age-friendliness” of today’s
jobs (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022) provides
something of a silver lining. Also, occupation-level data
suggest that older workers with college educations are
relatively well positioned to benefit from the productivity-boosting potential of AI because it complements
their tasks and skills (Box 2.3).
Overall, these findings suggest that healthy aging
can expand the effective labor supply of older individuals through higher labor force participation,
employment probability, numbers of hours worked,
and productivity. To assess how healthy aging can
mitigate the economic effects of population aging, the
next section incorporates these elements into a general
equilibrium analysis.

Economic Implications of Global
Population Aging
The economic impact of demographic shifts is
multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and
migration have an impact on both population growth
rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life
cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement—
chronological age thresholds defining economic activity
and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical
role. A rising share of the working-age population
(those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic
growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency
ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative
to the number in the working-age population) weighs
on growth and strains public finances on account of
higher spending on pensions, health care, and longterm care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan
beyond retirement age lengthens.5
Second, the expected length of working lives relative
to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If
life expectancy increases while the effective retirement
age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more
to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up
aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age
profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an
increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth.
5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than
statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic
implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective
retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement
age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely
reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity
of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers.

56

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases
capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These
forces combine and, on balance, tend to place downward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen,
and López‑Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic
Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2).6 The uneven pace of
these trends across economies due to aging will largely
shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and
others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging
on both growth and interest rates will have important
implications for public finances.
Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging
also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement
decisions. In line with findings in the previous section,
research suggests that physiological functioning is a key
predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and
productivity, independent of their chronological age
(Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in
how individuals age can thus affect education, work,
and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggregate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth.
Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates
opportunities for efficiency gains from cross-­border
reallocation of production factors. Capital may
flow from old, high-savings economies to younger,
capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances
(Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024).
Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger,
labor-abundant economies to older economies facing
labor scarcity.

The Model
This chapter employs an extension of the global
overlapping-generations model in Auclert and others
(2024) to assess the general equilibrium implications
of demographic forces for individual economies and
globally (see Online Annex 2.3 for details).
• Country coverage: The model includes 21 advanced
economies, 4 emerging market economies (including
China and India, which together account for almost
50 percent of emerging market economies’ GDP),
and a bloc economy comprising 44 low-­income
6The focus of the chapter is on aging-induced pressures on interest
rates due to changes in the age structure of economies and their
impact on savings supply and investment demand. However, the
future direction of interest rates is also shaped by other factors influencing investment demand, such as future productivity trends as well
as public spending to tackle pressing policy issues such as climate
change or national security.

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

7In the literature, the wedge in the interest rate that emerging market and developing economies face can be attributed to factors such as
a higher growth rate of the labor force (Carvalho and others 2023), a
lower degree of financial integration (Bielecki, Brzoza-Brzezina, and
Kolasa 2020), and market segmentation (Pellegrino, Spolaore, and
Wacziarg 2024).

countries (LICs) expected to pass their demographic
turning points after 2040 (denoted LIC bloc hereafter). Altogether, the model accounts for about twothirds of the world economy and population.
• Healthy aging: The country-specific age-productivity
profiles of workers vary over time to integrate the
impact of healthy aging on effective labor supply
(proxied by labor earnings, capturing effects on
labor productivity and number of hours worked)
documented in the previous section. Even if policies
supporting healthy aging remain unchanged, the
improvements observed over 2000–22 are likely to
persist for some time as current young workers who
benefited from those policies transition into old age.
Accordingly, the baseline assumes a continued—
though moderating—improvement in the functional
capacity of workers ages 50 and older over the next
three decades.
• Productivity: Apart from the effect of healthy aging
on age-productivity profiles, aggregate productivity
at the country level is driven in the model by three
forces, which are calibrated based on empirical evidence: the growth of total factor productivity (TFP)
at the global frontier, convergence toward the TFP
frontier, and the impact of demographics on TFP
growth through innovation and entrepreneurship
channels.
• Global capital market: The model assumes that the
integration of China, India, and the LIC bloc into
global capital markets is imperfect. This results in a
wedge between domestic and global interest rates for
these economies that is assumed to decline gradually
as they undertake credit and capital market reforms,
continue strengthening governance and institutions,
and become increasingly integrated in global financial markets.7
• Fiscal policy: Initial values for effective retirement
rates, labor taxes, retirement replacement rates,
and other public spending are calibrated to match
country-specific targets in the data. In the baseline,
effective retirement ages are assumed to increase by
one month per year over 60 years in all countries
(except for India and the LIC bloc, where they are

and other public spending adjust period by period
so that trajectories of debt-to-GDP ratios are aligned
with WEO projections until 2029 and remain stable
from then onward.

Implications of Aging under Current Policies
Under current policies, global growth is expected
to decline as population aging accelerates, but the
severity of the expected growth decline varies widely
across countries (Figure 2.9). Global average annual
growth over 2025–50 is projected to be about
1.1 percentage points lower than the average over
2016–18, and 2 percentage points lower when the
average over 2025–2100 is considered. Advanced
economies with relatively older populations (such as
Japan) will see their economies shrink. Other advanced
economies that are projected to avoid a decline in

8It is conceivable that investment rates may not fall by much

if aging-induced labor scarcity fosters investment in labor-saving
technologies (Goodhart and Pradhan 2020). If automation or AI
adoption responds endogenously to an aging population, interest
rates could face upward pressure, either from sufficiently large
productivity gains (Stähler 2021) or an increase in the capital share
in output (Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo 2022). These channels are not
accounted for in the model.

their working-age populations under baseline fertility and migration assumptions (such as Canada and
the United States) will continue to grow, albeit more
slowly over time.
In the group of emerging market and developing
economies, China will witness a particularly sharp
decline in its GDP growth over 2025–50—a deceleration of 2.7 percentage points relative to the 2016–18
average—reflecting acutely adverse demographics,
as well as the approaching end of the era of rapid
catch-up to frontier productivity. India, with its relatively favorable near-term demographics, is projected
to experience a smaller growth decline in 2025–50
(of about 0.7 percentage point), but the decline will
intensify over 2050–2100 as the country passes its
demographic turning point. Low-income countries are
also expected to see a sharper deceleration in growth
in the second half of the century, once demographic
dividends turn into headwinds.
The projected slowdown is generally smaller in
regard to output per capita, but most economies will
see a deceleration going forward. For the world average, and relative to 2016–18, output per capita growth
will be about 0.6 percentage point lower in 2025–50
and 1.8 percentage points lower toward the end of the
century.
Lower expected growth, combined with an increasing share of older populations, would reduce the
need for additional investments and push up desired
aggregate savings, resulting in downward pressure on
interest rates.8 However, the interest-growth differential (r – g) projected for the next 25 years is higher
than the 2016–18 average for all economies except
India and the LIC bloc—meaning that, all else equal, a
higher primary balance would be needed to keep debt
ratios stable. Average r – g for the world is projected
to be 1 percentage point higher in 2025–50 than in
2016–18, moderating to about 0.5 percentage point
toward the end of the century as population aging
increases global savings relative to investment demand
everywhere. Early- (late-)aging countries will see r – g
pressures easing (increasing) toward the end of the

century as aggregate savings and wealth evolve along
with the transition.
To keep debt-to-GDP ratios stable from 2030
onward, about half of the model economies are projected to need higher primary-balance-to-GDP ratios
than they had on average over 2016–18. Importantly,
this group includes the largest economies, such as China,
Japan, and the United States. The larger required fiscal
effort reflects the combination of adverse demographics
and the large increase in public debt many countries
have experienced since the onset of the pandemic.9
The uneven demographic trends would influence
the direction of future capital flows and contribute to
divergent net foreign asset positions across the world
over the long run. Large emerging market economies
(China and India) would accumulate foreign assets,
especially over 2050–2100, whereas many advanced
economies would gradually draw down foreign assets
throughout the projection horizon (Figure 2.10).

spending but does not include other age-related health care and longterm care spending. The European Commission Directorate-General
for Economic and Financial Affairs (2024) estimates these nonpension expenditures could increase by 1.2 percentage points of GDP
on average across member states, whereas education spending would
decline by 0.5 percentage point of GDP as a result of aging; the
spending impact would, however, be highly heterogeneous across
countries.

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

Growth Dividends from Healthy Aging
To what extent does healthy aging help to avert
an even steeper slowdown in GDP growth under
current policies? Results from counterfactual simulations indicate that the contribution to growth from
recent healthy-aging improvements will be sizable over
2025–50. For the world, healthy aging is projected to
add about 0.4 percentage point to GDP growth, on
average, over 2025–50 (Figure 2.11, panel 1). That
is, if expected gains from healthy-aging trends were
abstracted from, global output growth would be projected to slow by 1.5 percentage points—as opposed
to 1.1 percentage points—in 2025–50 when compared
with average growth in 2016–18.
The projected contributions of healthy-aging gains
to average annual output growth are positive and
sizable for all individual economies in the model,
ranging from about 0.3 percentage point to 0.6 percentage point. The contribution is particularly large
for India, for instance, as its share of workers ages
50 and older is projected to grow fast in that period,
whereas it is relatively lower in Japan, as its share of
older workers, though high, will grow at a slower
pace over 2025–50.
Under current policies, the contribution to growth
from healthy aging would gradually fade as current
cohorts of workers transition through their late adult
stage and into retirement. The average contribution
to world growth would be about 0.1 percentage point
over 2050–75 and would decline further thereafter.
Impact of Demographic Assumptions
The model simulations take as given United Nations
World Population Prospects (UNWPP) assumptions
regarding the future path of fertility and mortality
rates in individual countries. These demographic
assumptions are an important driver of the projected
growth slowdown under the baseline: They account for
about half of the slowdown in projected GDP growth
over 2025–2100 relative to the average in 2016–18.
More precisely, demographic forces alone—that is,
abstracting from the other forces considered in the
baseline, such as cross-country convergence in pro-

contribution of demographic forces to GDP growth
in 2025–2100 ranges from close to –2.8 percentage
points in India to –0.4 percentage point in Finland
and Slovenia.
Demographic projections are of course subject
to uncertainty. For instance, whereas the UNWPP
“medium” fertility projections used for the baseline
assume birth rates will eventually rebound in many
countries, fertility projections have been systematically
revised downward in recent years (see Online Annex
Table 2.3.1). On the other hand, authorities in more
than 50 countries, especially in Asia and Europe, where
the pace of aging has raised alarms, have adopted
policies to foster higher birth rates (United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2021).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

To assess the sensitivity of projections to fertility
assumptions, the model is simulated using alternative
UNWPP projections based on fertility rates higher and
lower than those in the medium-fertility scenario.10
Indeed, the expected contribution from demographics
to GDP growth in 2025–2100 varies widely with the
fertility assumptions, with the country-specific growth
estimates under alternative fertility assumptions varying, for instance, by 0.5 percentage point in Australia
and 1.6 percentage points in China. However, the contribution of demographics to GDP growth is mostly
negative under different fertility assumptions.

Growth Tailwinds from Labor Supply Policies
How can policies mitigate the adverse economic
impacts of population aging? There are three key
policy levers that could provide growth tailwinds amid
population aging: tackling the decline in participation
rates of older individuals, extending working lives
as life expectancy rises, and narrowing gender participation gaps (Figure 2.12). A set of alternative
scenarios is used to assess the general equilibrium
impact of addressing these issues (see details in Online
Annex 2.3):
Healthy-aging policies: Targeted health policies and
other initiatives can enable older workers to increase
their labor force participation rates. Indeed, the significant increase in the global median participation rate
between 2000 and 2024 in the 55–64 age group is
encouraging, but there is significant room for further
narrowing the participation gap with respect to primeage workers. A first model scenario assumes the rollout
of policies in areas such as health promotion and prevention that lead to a gradual narrowing of cross-country differences in the functional capacity of workers
ages 50 and older. Under such a scenario, the additional
long-term improvement in the functional capacity of
older individuals would reduce current cross-country
gaps by one-fourth and, on average, would be equivalent to about 49 percent of the estimated gains over
2000–22. The results indicate notable growth dividends
because of higher labor force participation rates for
older individuals who have not yet reached retirement
age, as well as higher productivity relative to the baseline (Figure 2.13). For the world, average annual GDP
growth over 2025–2100 would be about 0.2 percentage
10Under the UNWPP’s high- (low-)fertility scenario, fertility is

projected to remain 0.5 children above (below) the fertility rate in the
medium-fertility scenario over most of the projection period.

point higher over 2025–50.11
Higher effective retirement age: There is also scope for
increasing labor force participation among both men
and women in the 65-and-older age group, by postponing the effective retirement age given healthy-aging
improvements. This is not necessarily or exclusively
related to raising statutory retirement ages. Healthy
aging may encourage older workers to voluntarily delay
their retirement even if statutory retirement ages are
unchanged, depending on the incentives of pension
plans.12 A second scenario assumes that policy changes
11The scenario assumes all countries in the model implement
policy changes, but their magnitude and pace depend on initial
conditions. Countries at or close to the health frontier, which do not
see any additional improvement in the functional capacity of older
workers relative to the baseline, would not register growth dividends.
12At the same time, raising the statutory retirement age may not
yield the desired impact on effective retirement age if older workers are
not physically or cognitively able to remain active or if their productivity declines rapidly with age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024).

lead effective retirement ages to increase at a faster
pace than under the baseline in countries where life
expectancy at retirement is 20 years or more—in line
with prospective old-age thresholds (Sanderson and
Scherbov 2010; Kotschy and Bloom 2023)—while otherwise evolving as in the baseline. In such a scenario,
average annual GDP growth over 2025–2100 for the
world would be about 0.1 percentage point higher than
in the baseline. The growth dividends would be higher
in European economies, in which the gap between
effective retirement ages and life expectancy is large and
would increase further under unchanged policies.
Closing labor force participation gaps: Finally, average
labor force participation rates remain higher for men
across most countries, providing scope for closing
gender gaps in labor force participation. A third scenario assumes that policies lead to narrowing country-­
specific gender gaps in labor force participation by
three-fourths by 2040. Under this scenario, average
annual GDP growth for the world economy would be
0.1 percentage point per year higher than in the baseline over 2025–2100—and the difference would be
even larger, at 0.3 percentage point, over 2025–50—
with a particularly large boost in India given its current
large gender gaps.

Combined policy package: Combining the three labor
supply policy layers would yield sizable growth gains
and partly mitigate the projected growth decline in
the baseline. For the global economy, average annual
growth would be 0.3 percentage point higher over
2025–2100 than in the baseline scenario, reversing
about one-third of the drop in growth attributable to
demographic trends through the end of the century.
The boost to global growth would be even larger, at
about 0.6 percentage point, over 2025–50 (Online
Annex Figure 2.3.4), offsetting close to three-fourths of
the drag from demographics during that period. Some
countries—notably India, low-income countries, and
some European economies—could reap even higher
growth dividends. Equally meaningfully, keeping older
workers engaged in economic activities may offer nonmonetizable societal benefits from improved well-being
for a large portion of future societies (Scott 2023).
Fiscal Implications
How much could labor supply policies ease fiscal
pressures? These policies would first have direct implications for the primary balance of the public sector—
including but not limited to their impacts through
pension system balances. For instance, increasing
female labor force participation and employment could
boost labor tax revenues. Similarly, policies that raise
the effective retirement age would increase labor taxes
and reduce transfer payments.
Second, labor supply policies would also have an
impact on public finances through their effect on r – g.
Higher GDP growth would contribute to reducing
r – g and easing fiscal pressures—meaning that, all else
equal, a lower primary balance would keep the debt
ratio stable. However, labor supply policies could also
put upward pressure on interest rates because of lower
desired aggregate savings—due, for instance, to longer
expected working lives—and increased investment
demand to accommodate a larger labor force.13 The
overall effect on r – g would depend on how much
these reforms boost growth in individual countries and
13It is also important to acknowledge that government borrow-

ing costs may deviate from equilibrium interest rates considered
in the model as a result of factors related to the depth of markets
for sovereign debt, the international currency status of the country
issuing the debt, and increased debt issuance, as well as shifts in safe
asset demand or market sentiment regarding fiscal risks. Limited
market capacity to absorb large debt issuances may also put upward
pressure on government borrowing costs and cause gradual erosion
in the “convenience yield” on government debt; see, for example,
the discussion in Mian, Straub, and Sufi (2022) and the April 2023
WEO, Chapter 2.

14The sensitivity of global interest rates to labor supply policies is
partly related to households’ saving response to changes in growth
prospects, which is difficult to pin down with precision. Assuming a
different calibration for households’ willingness to substitute future
consumption for present consumption, the effect of progrowth
reforms on interest rates would be smaller, and r – g would decline
for almost all economies over 2025–50 (Online Annex 2.3).

on the sensitivity of global interest rates to improved
growth prospects. Model simulations indicate that five
model economies (Greece, India, Italy, Spain, and the
LIC bloc) would see some fiscal respite from lower
r – g over 2025–50, reinforcing the direct benefits of
labor policies on primary balances.14
Altogether, when the effect of labor supply policies
on primary balances and on r – g is considered, all
model economies would gain fiscal space under the
combined policy scenario. That is, they could afford
to increase spending on critical areas, such as climate-­
related initiatives reduce labor income taxes, or expand
transfers, while maintaining public debt targets. The
extent of additional fiscal space would nonetheless be
quite heterogeneous across countries. Assuming the
fiscal dividends from progrowth policies are employed
in equal proportions to reduce taxes, increase transfers,
and increase other spending, the gains would be equivalent, on average, to more than 4 percentage points
of GDP in Greece and Italy, but less than 1 percent
of GDP in China and the United Kingdom (Figure
2.14). An additional exercise shows that the fiscal
dividends from progrowth policies would allow many
countries—though not all—to gain fiscal space while
at the same time rebuilding buffers by reducing public
debt to its average level in 2016–18 (Online Annex
Figure 2.3.5). The differences in potential fiscal dividends across countries reflect variations in the direct
effect of labor supply policies on primary balances as
well as the interaction of higher interest rates with
different initial levels of debt.
One caveat to these findings is that implementing some of the policies considered here could entail
direct budgetary costs, which could lead to somewhat
smaller net fiscal dividends than implied by the model
simulations. Implementing active labor market policies, for instance, can entail costs (for example, Banerji
and others 2017). However, these policies also tend
to benefit older workers the most (April 2024 WEO,
Online Annex 3.2). Additionally, policies to foster
healthier aging are not necessarily fiscally costly. For
instance, taxes on alcohol and tobacco can generate
fiscal revenue, and preventive health policies can lead

higher effective labor supply and improved old-age dependency ratio relative to the

to future saving on health care spending (McDaid,
Sassi, and Merkur 2015). Because quantifying the
overall net fiscal cost from implementing the labor
supply policies considered in the chapter is subject to
large uncertainty, the model abstracts from these costs.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy
are leading to a sustained decline in population growth
and significant changes in the age structure of economies. As the share of the working-age population starts
to decline in more and more countries, and the workforce becomes tilted toward older ages characterized by
lower labor force participation and employment rates,
demographic forces seem to be casting long shadows
over prospects for living standards and public finances.
However, there is a silver lining to the rise of the
silver economy. The analysis in this chapter highlights
that individuals across a diverse set of economies
are aging in better health than previously. Increased
longevity has been accompanied by improvements in
the physical and cognitive capacities of older individuals across subsequent cohorts—although there are still

CHAPTER 2

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

sizable disparities across socioeconomic groups and
countries. Importantly, this healthier-aging trend has
also been associated with higher labor force participation rates, a higher likelihood of being employed, and
higher labor earnings for individuals ages 50 and older.
Nevertheless, population aging, together with
other forces such as waning catch-up growth in large
emerging market economies, is expected to depress
global economic growth. Even as ongoing gains from
healthy aging are estimated to boost annual global
growth by about 0.4 percentage point over 2025–50,
the analysis in this chapter indicates that under current
policies global output growth would decline on average
by about 2 percentage points through the end of the
century. With lower growth prospects and historically
high levels of public debt, many countries will need
significant fiscal efforts to keep debt-to-GDP ratios
stable beyond 2030.
A multifaceted policy approach is essential to deal
with these challenges. Broad-based improvement in
the functional capacity of individuals ages 50 and
older over the past few decades shows that aging can
be a malleable process (Scott 2023). Policies aimed
at improving the human capital of older workers can
enhance productivity and narrow the participation
gap with prime-age workers. Emphasizing health
promotion and prevention policies is warranted, and
these policies need to be carefully deployed to address
health inequalities. Measures that tackle behavioral risk
factors throughout the course of life—such as tobacco
smoking, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity,
and unhealthy diets—and other risk factors related to
the environment and mental health can decrease the
incidence of chronic diseases and health inequalities
(Liu and others 2016; Rashbrook 2019; Lee, Park, and
Lee 2020; Hacker 2024). Examples include immunization, regular health checks, screenings for chronic
diseases, campaigns to prevent substance abuse, taxation (for example, on tobacco and unhealthy food),
regulations (for example, those to promote smoke-free
environments), and providing access to mental health
resources. These measures often span beyond the
health care sector and are not necessarily costly. Evidence suggests many are cost-effective and can produce
savings by reducing expenditure on health intervention
down the road (McDaid, Sassi, and Merkur 2015;
OECD 2015). Yet spending on health promotion
and prevention accounts for only 1–6 percent of
total health expenditure in member countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-

opment and tends to be cut disproportionately during
downturns (Gmeinder, Morgan, and Mueller 2017;
Hacker 2024).
A comprehensive approach, combining pension
reforms, training, and workplace adaptations, should
complement health-oriented interventions to increase
effective retirement ages in line with improvements in
life expectancy. Besides changes to statutory retirement
ages, reducing early retirement benefits, introducing
incentives to postpone retirement, and allowing for
phased retirement can induce a rise in effective retirement age. Pension system reforms need to balance
sustainability with adequate protection to mitigate
old-age poverty and inequality (Amaglobeli and others
2019). More broadly, the malleability of aging and the
diversity in health status and experience among older
workers suggest that age-based provisions in policies
are likely to be inefficient and should be reconsidered
(see discussion in Scott 2023). Also, lifelong upskilling
and reskilling programs are crucial to ensure individuals remain employable as they age. This becomes
even more important at the cusp of a potential AI
revolution, in which skilled older workers will be well
positioned to reap the benefits given the complementarity of their skills with AI, whereas unskilled workers
may struggle to keep their jobs or manage successful
job transitions (Box 2.3). Enhancing adaptability
through flexible work arrangements and workplace
adjustments that improve the age-friendliness of jobs
can also support longer working lives. Combating
biases and discrimination against older individuals is
also important, as the former can limit access to reskilling opportunities and lead to premature exits from
the labor force (Gaillard and Desmette 2010; Lamont,
Swift, and Abrams 2015; Officer and others 2020;
Alcover and others 2021).
Policies aimed at reducing labor force participation
gaps, particularly by fostering higher female labor
force participation, can also provide substantial growth
dividends to counter demographic headwinds. To avert
an adverse impact on fertility, policies should aim for
improving the work-life balance for women, including
improved parental leave systems, expanding on affordable childcare options, and promoting flexible work
arrangements (Gu and others 2024).
Furthermore, enhanced global integration can
play a crucial role in supporting growth amid aging
trends occurring at different paces and timings across
countries. In particular, policies that enhance access
to international financial markets—including credit

63

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

and capital market reforms, as well as those strengthening governance and institutions (Budina and others
2023)—are key for enabling low-income countries to
reap the benefits of still-positive demographic dividends (Box 2.1). Gains from deeper financial integration can also offset the labor losses from migration
outflows toward advanced economies, in which
the additional workers can boost labor supply and
output amidst an aging and dwindling workforce (see
Chapter 3).
The simulations in this chapter suggest that a
combination of policies for boosting labor supply
could attenuate the slowdown in global growth over
2025–50 resulting from demographic headwinds
by almost three-fourths. Although these progrowth
policies could also contribute to higher global interest
rates, they would nonetheless provide substantial fiscal
dividends. Many countries would be able to rebuild
fiscal buffers and create additional fiscal space to
finance critical spending. Some economies, however,
would still require additional fiscal efforts given the
current precarious state of their public finances. In
those cases, an early, gradual, and sustained effort is
crucial to ensuring intergenerational fairness (Box 2.2)
and maintaining economic stability amid ongoing
demographic transitions.
Although policies to boost labor supply and facilitate cross-country factor mobility are key, they are
not a substitute for efforts to reignite technological
innovation and productivity growth—the ultimate
driver of improvements in living standards. Structural
reforms to promote market competition, financial
accessibility, and labor market flexibility can boost productivity growth by fostering innovation, facilitating

64

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

a more efficient allocation of capital and labor across
firms (see Budina and others 2023; April 2024 WEO,
Chapter 3). They can also help countries benefit from
technological advances such as AI-related technologies,
which are complementary to labor in occupations
more typical of older workers (Box 2.3) and can provide the latter with skills and methods for coping with
functional decline due to aging (Abril-Jimenez and
others 2022).
Technological progress and innovation can be important not only for countering the adverse effects of population aging on output growth, but also for enhancing
the malleability of aging itself. Promoting research and
development in the scientific understanding of biological aging has the potential to further extend healthy longevity in the decades ahead (Cox 2022). Furthermore,
AI-based solutions in health care hold potential for
transformation through scaling up of preventive health
practices (Chan and others 2024), for instance by automating routine tasks such as screening and diagnostics.
They can also bring clinical expertise to underserved
and remote areas, helping to reduce the heterogeneity in
physical and cognitive capabilities of older individuals
documented in this chapter. For example, the Aravind
Eye Care System in India has deployed AI-based tools to
screen millions of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy,
effectively addressing the country’s shortage of ophthalmologists and preventing vision loss among patients
(Yu, Beam, and Kohane 2018).
Ultimately, the rise of the silver economy brings
both challenges and opportunities, making a comprehensive and proactive policy approach essential for
navigating the challenges of population aging while
harnessing the benefits of longer, healthier lives.

CHAPTER 2

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

Box 2.1. Enhancing Global Financial Integration to Support Growth in
Low-Income Countries
Could capital flows from advanced to capital-scarce,
low-income countries help the latter grow faster and
capitalize on their demographic tailwinds? Would
gains from enhanced financial integration offset losses
from potentially larger migration outflows toward
older, rich countries? To answer these questions, this
box uses the model presented in the chapter and
focuses on alternative scenarios for cross-border capital
and labor flows in the low-income country group
(LIC bloc).
Firms in emerging market and developing economies face generally higher costs of capital than firms
in advanced economies when accessing global financial
markets. This wedge or premium may reflect credit
market imperfections, expropriation risks, bureaucratic inefficiencies, corruption, or any combination
of these factors (Gourinchas and Jeanne 2013). To
assess potential gains from financial integration, a first,
status quo scenario assumes that after the LIC bloc
starts from a zero net foreign asset position, capital
can flow from and toward it, but the initial wedge
between domestic and global interest rates, which
is set to 300 basis points in line with estimates in
Gerding, Henriksen, and Simonovska (2025), remains
unchanged throughout the simulation period. A
second, enhanced financial integration scenario assumes
instead that LIC bloc countries undertake credit and
capital reforms, improve their governance frameworks,
and strengthen their institutions such that the interest
rate wedge gradually declines until disappearing by
2070—assumptions similar to those for the baseline
projections in the chapter.
In the status quo scenario, the LIC bloc does import
capital from the rest of the world, but flows are limited. Net foreign liabilities peak at about 13 percent
of GDP (Figure 2.1.1, panel 1). From about 2050
onward, capital flows reverse as demographic shifts
in the LIC bloc push desired savings upward. In the
enhanced financial integration scenario, demand for
investment increases as the interest rate that domestic
agents face falls at a faster pace, leading to larger capital inflows and net foreign liabilities reaching about
180 percent of GDP by 2070–80. After that, as aging
accelerates in low-income countries, their net foreign
asset positions stabilize and then start to gradually
reverse toward the end of the century. The capital

stock and output are significantly higher than in the
status quo scenario, with the gap widening until the
2070s. Because the population dynamics are the same
across the two scenarios, both GDP and GDP per
capita are about 19 percentage points higher than in
the status quo scenario in the long term (Figure 2.1.1,
panel 2). As a result of the fact that the dividends
from part of the additional investment financed with
capital inflows accrue to nonresidents, the long-run
increase in gross national income per capita is smaller
than that for GDP, but it is still sizable at about
7 percentage points.

young, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity, attracted by higher wages
and better employment prospects. A key question is
whether the benefits from financial integration can
offset headwinds low-income countries may face
from potentially larger migration outflows. A third,
enhanced financial integration plus migration scenario
adds to the previous one by assuming also that the
annual flow of young migrants from the LIC bloc into
advanced economies gradually increases up to 2040
such that, from then onward, the annual outflows of
young migrants are twice as large as recent historical
flows and remain at that higher level thereafter.1 As
the labor force in the LIC bloc shrinks over time
relative to what occurs in the previous scenario, capital
accumulation slows down because of lower investment demand, and, consequently, capital inflows are
somewhat smaller. In the long term, with a smaller
1The model scenario assumes that the additional migrants,
beyond what is assumed in United Nations World Population
Prospects projections, are concentrated among individuals ages
20–24. This is a simplifying assumption that allows to abstract
from the net wealth of the additional migrants as the 20-year-old
cohort in the model is assumed to have zero net wealth.

workforce and less capital, aggregate GDP in the LIC
bloc would be about 5 percentage points lower relative
to that in the enhanced financial integration scenario,
but still 14.5 percentage points higher than in the
status quo scenario.
Since the additional migration flows are assumed
to be among young individuals, who have lower
labor force participation rates and productivity than
prime-age workers, GDP per capita in the LIC bloc
in the enhanced financial integration plus migration
scenario initially increases by more than it does without additional migration flows. Over time, however,
GDP per capita becomes lower than in the enhanced
financial integration scenario because the workforce
is smaller. In the long term, GDP per capita in the
LIC bloc is about 1.2 percentage points lower than in
the enhanced financial integration scenario but almost
18 percent higher than in the status quo scenario.
Overall, the results illustrate the importance of financial sector reforms and efforts to strengthen governance
and institutions in enabling low-income countries to
reap their demographic dividends before the window
for doing so closes and to offset potential output losses
from migration outflows to older economies.

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

Box 2.2. Intergenerational Considerations in Pension Reforms
Because the share of individuals ages 65 and older
is projected to increase steadily worldwide, relatively
fewer workers will be supporting more retirees, stressing pay-as-you-go pension plans and public finances.
Policymakers can employ different levers to adjust
pension plans so that they remain solvent, such as
increasing statutory retirement ages, increasing contributions from workers or firms, and reducing benefits
to pensioners. Policymakers often opt to postpone
unavoidable reforms, because the financial pressures
from aging accrue slowly. The choice of instruments
and their timing, however, can entail uneven reform
costs across cohorts and larger costs overall.
This box uses the Overlapping Generations and
Retirement model (Baksa and Munkacsi 2016) to
simulate the impact of pension reforms in a typical advanced economy. This is a dynamic general
equilibrium model with demographics, overlapping
generations, unemployment, and a rich fiscal sector.1 Population changes over time, with the changes
driven by shocks to fertility and mortality. The model
tracks the macroeconomic and fiscal implications
of aging and fiscal policy separately for two generations: the young, who work (or are unemployed)
and pay consumption and labor income taxes (or
receive unemployment benefits), and the old, who are
retired and receive pension benefits. Population aging
causes the labor force to shrink (in relative or absolute
terms), which, in turn, drags down the growth rates
of consumption, investment, and output.2 Aggregate
consumption and savings are also affected by the fact
that workers and retirees have different consumption
The authors of this box are Daniel Baksa and Zsuzsa Munkacsi.
1Stylized data on demographics, labor markets, GDP and its
components, and the fiscal sector are considered to capture the
long-term characteristics of the artificial economy.
2The precise impact is determined by which factor or factors
dominate (lower fertility, higher life expectancy, migration,
other factors, or a combination of these), as outlined in Baksa,
Munkacsi, and Nerlich (2020).

and saving patterns. The prospect of living longer
can also trigger precautionary saving. Shrinking labor
supply can contribute to higher capital-to-labor ratios,
reducing the need for further investment, which puts
downward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, aging
carries several fiscal challenges: Pension (and health)
spending can climb when the number of retirees rises,
whereas a shrinking labor force might imply lower
consumption and labor income tax revenues. As a
result, aging can push the public-debt-to-GDP ratio
upward.
The analysis considers three instruments for reforming pension plans. In regard to direct effects, higher
social security contributions affect the disposable
income of young workers, a reduction in the wage
replacement rate of pensions means lower benefits for
pensioners, and raising the statutory retirement age
implies a reduction in the number of retirees relative
to the number of workers. Policy changes employing
these instruments could also trigger indirect effects
through behavioral responses. The analysis considers
the impact of each reform separately and when implemented jointly as a package, as well as with immediate
implementation versus that with a 10-year delay. Each
reform scenario is calibrated such that the aging-­
induced increase in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is
reversed in 75 years (Table 2.2.1).
Simulations based on the model indicate that aging
would depress per capita consumption for both the
young and the old (with a larger decline in the case of
the older populations) in the absence of reforms (red
bars in Figure 2.2.1), because an increasing level of
public debt would need to be serviced. However, the
simulations also indicate that consumption losses can be
attenuated and shared more equitably across generations
if a reform that uses a mix of instruments is implemented, and if reforms start earlier rather than later:
• If reforms rely on a single instrument, sizable measures are needed. For instance, if only the retirement age is adjusted, an increase of six years would

be needed if the reform is implemented immediately (Table 2.2.1). However, under a combined
reform scenario, the increase in retirement age could
be less, at two years.
• The consumption losses from reforms that rely on a
single instrument are significantly larger than those
when a mix of instruments is used, at least for one

of the generations (Figure 2.2.1). Combining the
three measures helps ensure the burden is shared
across the young and old, potentially contributing
to the acceptability and feasibility of reforms (see
also the October 2024 World Economic Outlook,
Chapter 3, and the April 2025 Fiscal Monitor,
Chapter 2).
• The size of required fiscal measures is more
profound and aggregate consumption losses are
larger when the reforms are postponed for 10 years
compared with those in a scenario in which they are
implemented immediately. For instance, containing
the rise in public debt induced by aging requires a
6-year increase in the retirement age if the reform
is carried out immediately, but an 8-year increase
is needed if the reform is postponed by 10 years.
Moreover, the consumption losses from postponing
reforms usually fall disproportionately on the young
compared with the old.
In summary, policymakers should act sooner rather
than later, using a combination of tools to ensure a
fairer distribution of the burden across generations
and by doing so enhance the feasibility and acceptability of pension reforms. Although the exercise here
is calibrated for a typical advanced economy, with
a population that has already aged significantly, the
lessons are even more pertinent for emerging market
economies and low-income developing countries. As
of today, their old-age dependency ratios are lower
than those of advanced economies. However, they
will experience a faster pace of population aging than
did the latter, which means they will have less time to
react.

The Rise of the Silver Economy: Global Implications of Population Aging

Box 2.3. The Impact of AI for Older Workers
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping labor
markets, transforming the way individuals work,
communicate, and solve complex problems. Although
recent advances in AI technology hold great potential
to boost productivity by assisting workers and enabling
them to focus more on complex and high-value tasks,
they also pose risks by rendering certain skills obsolete,
thereby increasing the risk of unemployment. Older
workers (ages 55 and older) are particularly vulnerable,
as historical evidence suggests that they are less likely
to adapt to new technologies and transition to new
occupations (Autor and Dorn 2009). Without adequate policy interventions, disruptions resulting from
the realization of these risks may lead to reduced labor
market participation, lower numbers of working hours,
transitions to less suitable roles, premature workforce
withdrawal, or any combination of these outcomes—
further exacerbating labor market pressures in aging
economies. However, if older workers are concentrated
in occupations expected to expand and experience
productivity gains as a result of AI, they may be well
positioned to benefit from AI advancements, as long as
they are able to use new technologies.
To measure the initial impact of AI on labor
markets in a context of aging populations, this box
examines both AI exposure and its potential to complement older workers. Occupations can be grouped
into three categories: those at high risk of labor
substitution (high exposure and low complementarity,
or HELC), those likely to experience productivity and
wage boosts (high exposure and high complementarity,
or HEHC), and those less affected by AI adoption
(low exposure).1 Regardless of demographic shifts,
The authors of this box are Andresa H. Lagerborg, Carlo
Pizzinelli, and Marina M. Tavares.
1Exposure is measured by the extent to which AI can replicate
skills essential for a given occupation (Felten, Raj, and Seamans
2021), whereas the degree of complementarity measures how
likely AI is to augment workers in certain occupations (Pizzinelli
and others 2023). The complementary measure incorporates
broader occupational factors that influence the likelihood of
benefiting from AI adoption; see Pizzinelli and others (2023) for
details.

ongoing labor market trends indicate that occupations
vulnerable to automation are already losing ground to
those involving AI-enhanced roles. For instance, in the
United States, vacancies in HELC occupations have
expanded at a slower pace in locations with greater AI
adoption, whereas HEHC job vacancies have remained
stable or even increased slightly in these areas (Pizzinelli and others 2023).
The likely impact of AI on older workers, in a
manner similar to that in which it operates on younger
cohorts, will depend largely on their levels of education
(Figure 2.3.1). Workers with at most a high school
diploma are predominantly employed in occupations
with low exposure to AI, making them less susceptible
to disruption from AI adoption. In contrast, workers
with tertiary education are more exposed to AI, with
more than 80 percent employed in AI-intensive occupations. However, most of those are concentrated in
HEHC occupations, poised for productivity and wage
gains.2 This suggests that, for a given educational level,
older workers may benefit more from AI adoption
than younger cohorts, as the former are relatively more
concentrated in HEHC occupations.
Interestingly, several features of jobs with high
AI exposure are aligned with older workers’ preferences. Over the past three decades, there has been
a general rise in age-friendly jobs—characterized
by less-demanding physical activity, lower levels of
job hazards, and moderate work paces (Acemoglu,
Mühlbach, and Scott 2022). Such features are attractive for older workers and align with the positive gains
in their cognitive capacities amid healthy aging documented in this chapter.3 Indeed, data for the United
States suggest that AI-exposed jobs are compatible
2This is based on data for Brazil (National Household Sample
Survey) and the United States (Current Population Survey).
About 65 percent of workers in Brazil and 45 percent in the
United States work in HEHC occupations.
3Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott (2022) find that this rise in
age-friendly jobs has tended to benefit females, college graduates,
and older workers (especially females, those with college education, or both), whereas male graduates have benefited the least.

with working from home, and involve less physical
effort, relative to low-exposure jobs (Figure 2.3.2),
which enhances their appeal to older workers,
especially given that these AI-exposed jobs also
generally offer higher earnings. However, these same
occupations also involve higher levels of responsibility,
such as critical decision making, which can increase

Box 2.3 (continued)
stress and reduce the occupations’ desirability among
older workers. Despite these challenges, older workers
are already more represented in occupations poised to
benefit from AI than in those at risk from it. These
findings suggest that improving job conditions—
particularly through stress management, remote work
options, and flexibility—could help retain older workers in AI-enhanced roles.
Targeted policies remain necessary for older workers
in HELC occupations. Across different education
levels, 20–30 percent of older workers are employed in
HELC jobs vulnerable to AI-driven disruptions. This
group is particularly at risk, as historical data suggest
older workers are less likely to switch jobs or occupations (Figure 2.3.3). As labor demand for HELC
occupations declines, the ability of these workers
to relocate to growing sectors of the economy may
be limited, especially during the late stages of their
careers. This highlights the need for targeted policies
that facilitate job transitions. Active labor market programs can help older workers adapt to new technologies, and job transition support can mitigate the risk
of early retirement from job displacement.

JOURNEYS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLOVERS FROM MIGRATION AND
REFUGEE POLICIES

Emerging market and developing economies have found
themselves increasingly on the receiving end of migrant
and refugee flows, hosting the lion’s share of the latter. This
chapter examines how an economy’s policies to manage
legal inflows of migrants and refugees can have important
spillovers to other destination and transit economies, as
well as the economies from which these flows originate.
Tighter policies in other jurisdictions can increase inflows
to a given economy by 10 percent over five years. Furthermore, output in an average economy receiving these
additional inflows can increase by 0.2 percent over the
same horizon. The overall effect on output can often be
modest, as inflows can strain local resources and refugees
tend to be less well matched with skills needs in local
labor markets. However, output effects can be larger
should the skills of migrants and refugees complement
those of natives. The policy emphasis is on improving the
integration of migrants and refugees and minimizing
skills mismatches. In emerging market and developing
economies, the returns from better integrating refugees can
be particularly large. Furthermore, measures are needed
to alleviate pressures on local services and infrastructure,
by prioritizing productive public investment and promoting private sector development. International policy
cooperation can help distribute the short-term costs of
hosting large and unexpected inflows more evenly across
economies and improve outcomes over the long term.

Introduction
The legal movement of migrants and refugees has become an increasingly familiar fixture
of public debate. Flows, as a share of the global
population, steadily increased from the late 1990s

until the global financial crisis, broadly in line with
familiar globalization trends for goods and capital
(Figure 3.1).
As of 2024, the global stock of legal migrants and
refugees had reached 304 million—or 3.7 percent of
the global population—almost double that observed in
1995, with about one in six being refugees or asylum
seekers. Furthermore, about 40 percent of migrants
and 75 percent of refugees now reside in emerging
market and developing economies.
These patterns are the result of “pull” and “push”
factors—including geopolitical shocks and natural
disasters, which have increased in frequency—and
the configuration of migration and refugee policies.
Policies in destination economies, in particular, are
likely to have played an important role by altering
frictions—and therefore the costs and benefits—
associated with individual migration decisions.
Just as policies have helped shape the level and composition of observed legal flows, so too have changes
in the acceptance of migrants and refugees, which
has been deteriorating in several major destination
economies (Figure 3.2, panel 1). Increased media coverage of migration has further driven policy discourse
(Figure 3.2, panel 2). Survey responses suggest that
migration-related pressures are also unlikely to abate,
because the intention to migrate remains robust despite
the inability of all potential migrants to reach their
preferred destination (Figure 3.2, panel 3). Migrants
from emerging market and developing economies often
aspire to move to advanced economies—either within
or outside their region—but they are more likely to
end up in other nearby economies within the same
income group.
This chapter examines spillovers from changes in
migration and refugee policies in destination economies to other jurisdictions, unlike previous work,
which focuses on the impact of flows on origin and
destination economies. With globalization fatigue driving increasing barriers to the movement of both goods
and people and a weak global growth outlook, it is
important for policymakers to understand the impact

of changes in migration and refugee policies. Specifically, the chapter asks the following questions:
• Do changes in migration and refugee policies divert
legal migrant and refugee flows to other economies
or alter their composition?
• How large and significant have spillovers to output
from migration and refugee policy changes been?
• Could international cooperation improve economic
outcomes by distributing flows more evenly across
economies?
The analysis in the chapter focuses exclusively on
“regular”—also referred to as “legal”—cross-border
movement of migrants and refugees. Severe data constraints preclude analysis in the chapter of irregular—
also referred to as “illegal”—movement of people.1
The term migrant is used to denote those persons who
voluntarily leave their countries of origin for a variety of reasons, including to pursue better economic
opportunities. In contrast, the term refugee refers to
those persons who are forced to flee their countries of

broadly covers the movement of persons that takes place outside the
laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry

very nature of these flows being outside legal pathways, severe data
limitations and selection bias preclude the analysis of such flows.

origin and are unable or unwilling to return and are
afforded protection under international law.
The scale of migrant and refugee flows—as well
as their integration—can drive economic outcomes
in destination economies in the short and long term
through changes in labor supply, aggregate demand,
congestion, and agglomeration (see Online Annex 3.1
for key definitions, additional details, and labor
market outcomes).2 As a result, inflows of people can
have positive effects on output and labor productivity, although (concentrated) increases can drive up
short-term costs by straining local infrastructure and
reducing capital-to-labor ratios. Effects can also vary
according to pathways—refugees tend to face higher
barriers to integration and greater skills mismatches
than migrants.
The chapter takes existing push and pull factors and
migration barriers as given. It starts by documenting
key global and regional trends regarding the direction
and composition of legal migration and refugee stocks
and flows and the evolution of related policies. It then
provides a primer on potential spillovers induced by
migration and refugee policy changes before presenting
empirical evidence on spillovers from such changes,
both for legal migration and refugee flows and output.
Motivated by this empirical evidence, the final section
uses model-based analysis to quantify the growth and
long-term welfare impacts of changes in migration
and refugee policies—taking into account different
pathways and skills. It also provides insights on how
international policy coordination can improve outcomes compared with unilateral measures in response
to forced-displacement shocks.
The main conclusions of the chapter are as follows:
• Legal migration and refugee flows have been rising,
with an increasing role for movement between
emerging market and developing economies—
particularly for refugees—and with strain being
placed on economies with often limited absorptive
capacity.
• Rising flows, public discourse, and tensions in key
advanced economy destinations have gone hand
in hand with migration and refugee policy tightening over time, potentially adding to challenges
faced by emerging market and developing economy
destinations.

WEO.

• There is evidence at the global level that spillovers
from migration and refugee policy changes work
through several channels. These spillovers can be
significant in terms of flows of people, but relatively
modest in terms of output for the average economy.
◦ Policy tightening that deters inflows by
20 percent in one set of economies can result
in a significant deflection of people—increasing
inflows to other economies by 10 percent
cumulatively over five years. Furthermore, policy
changes can alter the composition of inflows
to a destination economy: For example, tighter
policies that reduce migrant inflows by 20 percent
over five years can be partly offset by a 30 percent
increase in the typically smaller inflows of refugees over the same period.
◦ Deflected flows to the final destination—
equivalent to an average increase in the immigrant
share of its population of about 0.2 percentage
points—are associated with a 0.2 percent increase
in output after five years.
◦ Instead, if other countries tighten only their refugee
policies, the resulting diversion of refugees does
not generate meaningful output gains in the final
destination. However, stronger refugee integration
policies can deliver better outcomes, notably among
emerging market and developing economies.
• Model-based simulations highlight how policies that
deflect legal flows of migrants and refugees to other
destinations or induce them to pursue alternative
legal pathways can have economic implications
between and within destination economies, depending on the degree of labor market integration and
skills matches.
◦ A reduction in legal migration inflows from
policies targeting selected origin economies is
partly offset by an increase in refugees from those
economies—particularly low-skilled refugees.
At the same time, migrants are deflected toward
bordering economies.
◦ The cumulative economic impact in the short to
medium term is a modest lowering of GDP in
destination economies, with a small boost to output elsewhere because their labor supply increases.
◦ In economies that have received deflected
migrants or refugees, increased competition may
reduce wages for some workers—notably in the
short term—while the incomes of natives engaged
in activities complementary to the skills of incoming migrants and refugees increase.

The analysis is emphatic. Shifts in migration and
refugee policies in destination economies can result
in spillovers by altering flows of legal migrants and
refugees in the global economy. Although these policy
changes cannot substitute for actions to sustainably
address underlying pull and push factors, particularly
those relating to forced displacement, they can help
manage flows to these economies’ benefit. Improving
behind-the-border migration and refugee policies on
integration, together with infrastructure investment
and active labor market policies, can help ease shortterm congestion costs. International cooperation can
also help redistribute these costs.

Migration and Refugee Patterns
and Policies
Advanced economies continue to host some of
the largest groups of migrants, mostly pulled from
emerging market and developing economies.3 Flows to
advanced economies accounted for the bulk of global
movements in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since
then, flows of both migrants and refugees between
emerging market and developing economies have
increased and now account for almost half of overall
net flows, with three of the five largest increases in
migrant and refugee stocks during 2010–24 having
taken place in large emerging market economies
(Figure 3.3). During 2020–24, most gross flows were
also between economies within the same region and
income group, highlighting the fact that migration
and refugee journeys are frequently undertaken only
over short distances (Figure 3.4).
Recent developments also reflect a significant
increase in flows of refugees who have been forcibly
displaced or pushed from their homes by political
instability, conflict, violence, persecutions, human
rights violations, and natural disasters. About twothirds of the stock of refugees are hosted in neighboring countries, with four out of the top five hosts
being emerging market and developing economies
(Box 3.1).4 The global distribution of refugees can
3These pull factors involved can include higher standards of
living—including higher incomes, better health outcomes, stronger
educational systems and institutions, and a safer environment—as
well as linguistic, or cultural proximity, or family ties.
4Political instability, conflict, and natural disasters can contribute
to push individuals from their homes and are key factors behind the
increase in migrant and refugee flows between emerging market and
developing economies. Deteriorating social and economic conditions
and a lack of opportunities in origin economies are other examples
of push factors.

Economic implications will vary according to the
characteristics of migrant and refugee inflows. In
general, migration has been found to be beneficial for
advanced economies.

to be more responsive to changes in labor market
conditions arising from both cyclical factors and
structural changes—such as demographic and sectoral shifts.5
• Migrants and refugees—who tend to have significantly lower age profiles than the native population
(April 2020 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 4; Box 3.2)—can generate economic gains that
outweigh fiscal costs and even ease fiscal pressures if
they are well integrated into the labor force (Clemens 2024; Box 3.3; see also the April 2025 WEO,
Chapter 2).
• Furthermore, migrants and refugees may help contain (wage push) inflationary pressures by increasing the labor supply, as observed across multiple
sectors in advanced economies since the pandemic
(Cheremukhin and others 2024). These effects can
be more pronounced where native workers have
skill levels similar to those of migrants and refugees.
5There is evidence that immigrants are more responsive to labor
shortages than natives, which reflects, in part, the fact that they have
already incurred labor mobility costs. See Online Annex 3.2 for more
details.

more details.

However, migrants can also contribute to inflationary pressures by raising demand (Manacorda,
Manning, and Wadsworth 2012; April 2020 WEO,
Chapter 4; Box 3.4).
• Overall, migration policy frameworks will determine
how job vacancies are filled between natives and
migrants—the latter tend to mobilize in sectors in
which labor demand is high, jobs are hard to fill,
and barriers to entry are lower (Figure 3.5; Online
Annex 3.2).
Meanwhile, refugees frequently struggle to join the
labor force or find employment opportunities that
fully utilize their skills. The benefits from their contributions are larger, notably in the long term, if they are
well integrated into the labor market. Evidence indicates that the complementarity of migrants and refugee
skills with those of natives and the strength of integration policies matter also for emerging market and
developing economies (Viseth 2021). However, even in
situations in which refugees have a common language
and culture, legal and structural barriers mean that
they tend to work in the informal sector (Alvarez and
others 2022). These findings also suggest that there

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

is no significant displacement of natives by refugees,
but instead there are potential productivity losses from
skills mismatches and labor misallocation.
Certain migration and refugee policies have become
increasingly restrictive for the median economy in
recent decades, whether in response to the stock of
existing migrants and refugees, or to recent inflows, or
to a failure to integrate.6 For instance, some countries have tightened external regulations (Figure 3.6,
panel 1: see Online Annex 3.1 for key definitions).
These are targeted primarily toward migrants, and
include skills targeting and minimum ages. Meanwhile,
the previous easing trend for internal regulations—
including integration measures—has stalled with
greater variation across countries (Figure 3.6, panel 2).
Furthermore, the stringency of regulation enforcement
(controls) has increased, although it has tapered off
over time (Figure 3.6, panel 3).

A Primer on Spillovers from Migration
and Refugee Policy Changes
Changes in migration and refugee policies can
alter the flow of migrants and refugees within and
between economies through four main channels (see
Figure 3.7).
• Stricter policies in destination economies may not
reduce the overall magnitude of flows from origin
economies but may alter their composition, as
targeted restrictions can lead to shifts between the
flows of migrants and refugees. This is referred to as
categorical substitution.
• Restrictions in one or more destination economies
may divert migrants and refugees to other destinations or leave them stranded in transit economies.
This channel is labeled destination substitution or
deflection.
• Migrants and refugees from other origin economies
may be encouraged or more likely to fill the gap
caused by the restrictions placed on flows from targeted origin economies. This is origin substitution.
• In some cases, stricter policies may dissuade
migrants from traveling altogether: origin suppression
or deterrence.
6Migration and refugee policies are collectively the set of laws,
regulations, and programs that governments use to facilitate, regulate,
and optimize migration outcomes. Although refugees are afforded
protection under international law, their integration into an economy is governed by domestic regulations and controls.

Estimating Spillovers from Migration
and Refugee Policy Changes
This section uses a structural gravity model and
local projections to assess the historical impact of
migration and refugee policy shifts on flows and
associated economic outcomes. The gravity framework
allows for a globally consistent evaluation of changes
in migrant and refugee flows following a change in
policies, taking the relative economic size, geography,
and bilateral linkages between destination and origin

Note: The figure shows four channels of flows between destination and origin economies following a migration policy tightening in Destination A toward Origin B, all else

may also move to Destination A (origin substitution).

economies as given (Online Annex 3.3).7 Subsequently,
output effects for final destination economies in
response to policy-induced immigration shocks derived
from the gravity model are estimated using local projections (Jordà 2005).
The gravity framework assumes that flows between
two economies are directly proportional to their size
and inversely proportional to their distance from one
another; they are also subject to the relative barriers
each country faces with respect to trading partners
(“multilateral resistance”). The framework controls for
trade linkages, multilateral resistance, and past migration flows but also includes a measure of the exposure
of an economy’s migration and refugee flows to the

policies of other destination economies using a “shiftshare” instrument.8 The coefficient on this instrument
provides an estimate of the additional migrant and
refugee inflows when alternative destination economies tighten migration and refugee policies (effects of
destination substitution). The gravity model is further
extended to estimate the sensitivity of flows of each
category—migrant and refugee—to policy changes in
destination economies that specifically target either
category (categorical substitution; Ottaviano, Peri, and
Wright 2013).
Using data for 194 economies from 1995 to 2020,
the gravity model provides clear evidence of destination substitution: Tighter policies that deter 20

7The analysis builds on Anderson (2011); Bertoli, FernándezHuertas Moraga, and Ortega (2013); Ortega and Peri (2013);
Beverelli and Orefice (2019); and Guichard and Machado (2024),
which estimate gravity models adapted for migration.

8This shift-share measure is constructed as a weighted average of
migration policies across alternative destination economies (Online
Annex 3.3).

percent of migrant and refugee inflows in one set of
destination economies lead to an increase of almost
10 percent in others over five years, all else equal
(Figure 3.8, panel 1).9 These effects are slightly more
pronounced for advanced economies than emerging
market and developing economies. They are also
largest when internal regulations are tightened—
making the integration of migrants into destination
economies more challenging—and relatively modest
when the enforcement of controls is stricter (Figure
3.8, panel 2). Furthermore, a 2 percentage point rise
in the share of deflected migrant and refugee inflows
in the destination economy’s population is associated

with an increase in output in that economy of about 2
percent over a five-year period (Figure 3.8, panel 3).10
As such, for the average destination economy—where
inflows are close to 2 percent of the population—a
10 percent increase in inflows equates to an increase
in output of about 0.2 percent. The output effects
hold regardless of which type of regulation tightens,
in line with previous findings (Figure 3.8, panel 4;
April 2020 WEO, Chapter 4).11 Additional analysis
using a richer dataset on refugee policies, with greater
coverage of emerging market and developing economies, shows a similar impact on migration and refugee
inflows as a result of tighter refugee policies elsewhere
(Online Annex 3.3).
The short to medium-term-output responses to
policy-induced migration shocks vary by destination
economy group and migrant category. Additional flows
are associated with output increases in advanced economies, whereas the output impact in emerging market
and developing economies is muted when integration
is not accounted for.12 This partly reflects not only
advanced destination economies’ relatively stronger
capacity to absorb different categories of arrivals
into their labor force, but also their relatively smaller
inflows of refugees.13
Tightening of migration policies leads to categorical
substitution toward refugees (Figure 3.9, panel 1). A
tightening designed to reduce average annual migration
flows by about 4 percent into a destination economy
over one year can be partly offset with an increase
of more than 25 percent in the typically smaller
refugee inflows to that economy. These additional
refugee inflows lead to modest output effects in the
short term. The modest effects capture the fact that
migrants—who could otherwise have been quickly
and efficiently matched to labor market needs, thus
boosting output—instead use an alternative pathway
10A 2 percentage point rise in the share of deflected migrant and

refugee inflows in the destination economy’s population is also associated with a decline in output per worker of just under 0.2 percent
over a five-year period, although the latter is not precisely estimated.
11Chapter 4 of the April 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO)
finds that a 1 percent increase in migration inflow-to-employment
ratios can increase output in advanced economy destinations by up
to 1 percent after five years, with the increase driven by a mix of
higher productivity and employment growth.
12In line with aggregate results, impacts on GDP per worker within
advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies
are found to be small and negative, but imprecisely estimated.
13Consistent with this observation, Chapter 4 of the April 2020
WEO finds no positive macroeconomic effects from increased refugee
inflows in emerging market and developing economies.

with greater integration challenges. Furthermore, estimates suggest that a tightening of refugee policies by a
set of destinations—designed to reduce refugee inflows
into those economies by 60 percent over one year—is
associated with an increase in refugee inflows into
other economies of close to 8 percent within one year
(Figure 3.9, panel 2). Deflected refugee inflows resulting from stricter refugee policies elsewhere—capturing
destination substitution effects—do not generate
meaningful output gains on average, given absorption
challenges. However, estimates using indicators with
a better coverage of integration policies—such as
naturalization and greater ease of movement within a
country—indicate that output effects are much larger
for emerging market and developing destination economies where integration policies are stronger (Online
Annex 3.3).
Beyond aggregate output effects, shifts in migration
flows can have broad-ranging macroeconomic impacts
on destination economies. For instance, empirical
studies find positive impacts of immigration on

productivity—often attributed to complementarities
between native and immigrant workers (Peri 2011;
Ortega and Peri 2014; Alesina, Harnoss, and Rapoport
2015; Jaumotte, Koloskova, and Saxena 2016). Such
complementarities are also cited by the literature for
limited evidence that migration affects the wages or
employment of native workers (Kerr and Kerr 2011;
Peri 2014). High-skilled immigration, in particular, is associated with better economic outcomes,
including higher wages for natives and enhanced firm
performance.
The results from the gravity model suggest that
there are spillovers from changes in migration and
refugee policies. However, care is required to interpret them: Migration and refugee flows may influence policies rather than the other way around, and
measurement error may exist, resulting from, among
other factors, lack of comprehensive data on bilateral
migration policies.14 Nonetheless, questions remain
regarding the macroeconomic implications of policy
spillovers for the global economy and their welfare
impacts given the existence of multiple spillover channels, alternative legal pathways for immigration, and
various integration frictions.

Modeling Spillovers from Migration and
Refugee Policy Changes
In this section, a spatial dynamic general equilibrium model of trade and migration is used to conduct
two exercises that evaluate (1) the distributional implications of targeted migration and refugee policy tightening and the associated costs and benefits to different
economies over varying time horizons; and (2) whether
international coordination can generate better outcomes than unilateral policy changes, by trading off
potential short-term costs of immigration for longterm benefits (Caliendo and others 2021, 2023).15 In
addition to modeling changes in the overall flow of
migrants and refugees between economies—allowing
for both deflection and deterrence—the model’s framework distinguishes between the different legal pathways
14Relatedly, a gravity framework based on an aggregate assessment

of an economy’s migration policies may underestimate the magnitude
of spillovers, given that adjustments to migration policies often
target flows from specific countries of origin or correlate with policy
changes in other destination economies.
15In the first exercise, the targeted migration policies apply to
both new and incumbent migrants, that is, they alter both barriers to
enter and those to remain. Both exercises use a historical episode as
a baseline.

available for migrants and refugees and varying degrees
of labor market integration in destination economies,
both of which are necessary to capture the effects of
categorical substitution (Online Annex 3.5).
Several important features drive the modeling
results. Individuals choose whether and where to
migrate and which pathway to use, given policy and
nonpolicy migration costs, as well as the real wages
they can earn in different destinations, which reflect
factors such as the complementarity of their skills with
those of residents. The economic impact of policy-­
induced changes in flows depends largely on two
opposing forces: (1) agglomeration, wherein a net inflow
of migrants can lead to higher total factor productivity
from, for example, knowledge spillovers and increased
entrepreneurship; and (2) congestion, which stems from
increasing strain on local services, businesses’ equipment and properties, and publicly provided infrastructure, such that an increase in population lowers capital
per worker in the short to medium term (Saiz 2007;
Melo, Graham, and Noland 2009; Kline and Moretti
2013; Colas and Sachs 2024). Over the long term,
economies that successfully build capital can reap the
benefits of net migration flows, increasing potential
output per capita.

Distributional Implications of Targeted
Migration Policies
In the first exercise, tighter policies in a destination
economy that target migrants from certain origin
economies are assumed to reduce the stock of migrants
from these economies by 20 percent over the short to
medium term relative to the baseline.16 As a result,
0.25 percent more of the native population remains in
the origin economies (origin suppression). At the same
time, flows—of both low- and high-skilled refugees—
through the refugee pathway increase (categorical substitution). Relative to the baseline, low-skilled refugee
flows increase by 4 percent, and high-skilled refugee
flows increase by 0.5 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 1).

16These flows tend to be small as a share of the overall population

in the destination economy. In this exercise, migrants account for
0.3 percent of the population from the origin countries and roughly
half of that amount when measured in percent of the population
in the destination economy. The 20 percent reduction in economic
migration is broadly comparable to the predicted outflows following
a one-standard-deviation increase in labor migration indices from
the Immigration Policies in Comparison (IMPIC) database—which
capture migration tightening of policies targeted at migrants.

Note: The panel presents the results from counterfactual simulations of a general
equilibrium model of trade and migration. Figures show the responses of migration
flows after five years.

The exercise also finds significant deflection of
migrants toward bordering destination economies
(destination substitution). The increase in flows to
these alternative destinations from the targeted origin
economies is broad-based across migrants and refugees,
although larger in the case of low-skilled refugees,
which increase by 2 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 2). The
increased inflows of low-skilled refugees reflect relatively
lower barriers for this pathway compared with the baseline, and the prospect of higher incomes for low-skilled
workers. The results also indicate that the implementing jurisdiction receives larger flows of low-skilled
migrants and refugees from economies bordering those
to which the tighter migration policies were targeted
(origin substitution). By contrast, a higher share of highskilled workers from these bordering economies refrain
from emigrating altogether to take advantage of the
productivity gains from skill complementarities with
the deflected low-skilled workers and agglomeration.

Note: The figure presents the results from counterfactual simulations of a general equilibrium model of trade and migration. In panels 1 and 2, output responses after five
years are denoted as “short to medium term”; lifetime output effects are denoted as “long term.” Panels 3 and 4 show compensating variation in lifetime real income from
the policy intervention, weighted by income shares in country of residence.

The resulting reallocation of labor across
countries—both its level and its composition—can
have redistributive and efficiency implications. In the
short to medium term, output in the implementing
jurisdiction declines modestly by close to 7 basis
points, partly as a result of the smaller flows relative
to the baseline, which leads to reduced labor supply and agglomeration (Figure 3.11, panel 1). The
reduction in migrants is only partly offset by more
refugees (categorical substitution), who cannot easily
integrate into the labor force and whose skills are more
often mismatched. Meanwhile the origin and bordering economies see a small increase in output. Lower
output per worker in origin and bordering economies
results from greater congestion, while lower inflows
alleviate congestion in the implementing jurisdiction
(Figure 3.11, panel 2).
Over the long term, output in the implementing
jurisdiction is lower relative to the baseline, as capital
accumulation slows and output per worker declines.
Targeted origin economies also incur costs from lower

output per worker in the long term, with the rate of
capital accumulation—absent free capital mobility
across countries—being insufficient to offset negative
congestion effects.17 In contrast, bordering economies
are assumed to be able to replenish capital over the
long term, because the gains from agglomeration are
stronger and investment opportunities greater, resulting
in higher output per worker relative to the baseline.
Overall, targeted tighter migration policies lead to
slightly lower global output than under the baseline in
both the short to medium term and in the long term,
as more workers remain in relatively lower-productivity
economies. Global output declines by about 2 basis
points in the short to medium term and 7 basis points
over the long term.
17This assumption implies conservative output effects, as deviations
from free capital mobility imply slower capital adjustment. The latter
is consistent with evidence that capital fails to flow from rich to poor
countries (April 2024 WEO, Chapter 3), and with the weak effect
of remittances on economic growth, as remittance inflows tend to be
accompanied by labor outflows (Clemens and McKenzie 2018).

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

The distributional effects of a targeted tightening of
migration policies in destination economies vary within
and between economies (Figure 3.11, panels 3 and 4).
• Real incomes of native capital owners in the implementing jurisdiction will be lower than the baseline
because of the decline in the labor supply and associated productivity losses. In contrast, capital owners
in origin and bordering economies will benefit.
• Native low-skilled workers in the implementing
destination economy will also benefit from the
protection afforded by tighter migration controls,
but an increase in low-skilled labor in the origin and
bordering economies depresses real incomes in those
locations.
• With fewer opportunities to migrate, high-skilled
workers in origin economies are adversely affected
because of congestion. High-skilled workers are also
worse off in destination economies relative to the
baseline because the inflow of complementary lowskilled workers has decreased.
• The negative welfare impact on natives in origin
economies reflects fewer opportunities to relocate to
higher-productivity destinations. Moreover, migrants
and refugees stand to lose in all locations from
restricted mobility.

Can Cooperation Help Destination Economies
Achieve Better Outcomes?
The second exercise assesses the potential for international cooperation to help destination economies
manage inflows. Three alternative policy scenarios are
simulated relative to a baseline. The latter is calibrated
using a large historical episode of forced displacement,
in which additional inflows impose short- to medium-term congestion costs, which may be more than
the implementing jurisdictions would be prepared
to accept.18 The scenarios consider the trade-off at
different horizons under alternative policy-tightening
settings for a set of bordering (emerging market and
developing) destination economies and a large nonbordering (advanced) destination economy.19
• The first two scenarios consider unilateral policy tightening by both the bordering and the
nonbordering destination economies, under the
18The focus of this exercise is on regional cooperation, consistent
with findings that most migration and refugee flows are intraregional
(Figure 3.4).
19The model used in this exercise does not feature skill heterogeneity and has only one migration pathway, owing to data limitations
and to focus the analysis on the short- to medium-term impact.

86

assumption that congestion costs in the baseline are
greater than what these economies are prepared to
bear: In the first scenario, policy barriers are raised
by the bordering emerging market and developing destination economies, and in the second by
the large advanced economy. In both cases, policy
barriers are temporarily increased to reduce short- to
medium-term inflows by 25 percent relative to the
baseline.
• The third scenario explores the outcome of international cooperation. Both destinations agree to take
more inflows than under the previous two scenarios.
Therefore, each jurisdiction temporarily tightens
its policies to reduce short- to medium-term net
inflows by 12.5 percent relative to the baseline.
In the first two scenarios, tighter policies reduce
congestion in each implementing jurisdiction in the
short term, boosting per capita consumption relative to
the baseline (Figure 3.12). However, there is a longterm cost once the capital stock adjusts, with smaller
agglomeration effects lowering total factor productivity.
The impact on aggregate consumption in each destination is negative in the short to medium term, as the
labor force shrinks relative to the baseline. The smaller
labor force leads to lower investment, amplifying the
initial decline in aggregate consumption. However, the
long-term impact is smaller as policy barriers return to
the baseline.
In the third scenario, both sets of destination
economies experience more congestion in the short to
medium term and stronger agglomeration effects in the
long term (Figure 3.12, red squares). Because the labor
force does not shrink as much as in the first two scenarios, aggregate consumption decreases by less over time.
In this way, destination economies can coordinate to
choose policies that produce stronger long-term benefits.

Conclusions and Policy Implications
Migration and refugee policies have become a critical part of public policy in the context of an anemic
growth outlook and growing demographic pressures.
In addition to documenting rising legal migration and
refugee flows—particularly between emerging market
and developing economies—and barriers, the chapter
finds the following:
• Changes in migration and refugee policies can have
large and significant effects on flows both within
and between economies. However, it is important to
note that such flows constitute a small share of the

population of advanced destination economies—
averaging about 2 percent over five years.
• Spillovers from migration and refugee policy shifts
propagate globally through a mix of channels—
primarily destination substitution and categorical
substitution—with macroeconomic implications. By
altering the size and composition of legal migrant
and refugee flows, policy changes can impose shortterm costs—particularly when flows are diverted to
jurisdictions in which labor market integration is
challenging or skill mismatches are more severe—
but also offer long-term gains.
• Beyond the better handling of large unexpected
forced displacement shocks, international cooperation can help distribute the short-term costs of
hosting refugees more evenly across countries, while
alleviating the burden on individual economies.

Such initiatives stand to benefit emerging market
and developing economies, which tend to lack fiscal
space and absorptive capacity.
Overall, domestic migration and refugee policies can
help manage inflows in a beneficial way for destination economies while also providing opportunities
for migrants and refugees. Precise policy prescriptions
in response to inflows will vary according to country
characteristics, economic circumstances, and the nature
of the inflows being received. However, overarching
recommendations include the following:
• Improving integration of migrants and refugees to
maximize gains for destination economies. Integration
challenges can undermine the benefits of migration
and tend to be more severe for refugees than for
migrants. Possible explanations include the unexpected nature and scale of these inflows (relative to
local populations), as well as the time it takes to be
granted refugee status and refugees’ relatively limited
access to local labor markets thereafter:
◦ Emerging market and developing destination
economies tend to receive a disproportionate
share of refugees, who are more often absorbed
into the informal economy. Strengthening
incentives to take up formal work—including
through well-designed tax and transfer systems
and improved access to public health and education services—can help these economies reap the
benefits of these inflows.
◦ More broadly, integration efforts across destination economies require minimizing domestic
barriers to occupational mobility. Policies to
improve skills matching among, and employment outcomes for, refugees include minimizing
administrative delays, which can cause harmful
gaps in employment history; providing language
training; and improving recognition and transferability of qualifications. Other policies that
can further improve labor market flexibility—for
natives, migrants, and refugees—include providing access to job search services and investment in
education to allow for upskilling and (re)training
of new entrants. Such policies allow migrants to
fill labor shortages as they arise, including those
in youth-intensive activities.20
20Many advanced destination economies already use targeted
(skills-based) migration policies—such as the H1B visa program in
the United States and points-based systems in Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom—to fill shortterm shortages in labor markets.

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

• Prioritizing productive public spending and structural reforms to alleviate congestion. Governments in
destination economies should seek to minimize the
strain that large inflows may put on resources, by
prioritizing public investment in infrastructure and
health and education services.21 Furthermore, in the
wake of unexpected inflows of refugees and potential short-term congestion costs, governments should
also work together to provide humanitarian support
and services, as well as capacity development. These
efforts should be complemented with domestic
reforms to increase private sector development to
21Such investments critically rely on the availability of fiscal space
and of financing and emphasize a potentially important role for
international financial assistance for many emerging market and
developing economies. The latter aligns with the Global Compact
on Refugees, which seeks to ease pressures on destinations and foster
macroeconomic stability and growth (as seen in Jordan [Hoogeveen
and Obi 2024]).

88

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

help economies better absorb inflows by providing
greater opportunities, notably where fiscal space is
limited.
Large unexpected and diverted migration and refugee inflows can aggravate social tensions, particularly
where the capacity to absorb inflows is limited. Yet
implementing restrictive migration and refugee policies
can, in some cases, cut off a valuable opportunity to
boost productivity and potential output while shifting
the burden of congestion elsewhere. Furthermore,
migration and refugee policies cannot fully address
pressures from forced displacement or structural bottlenecks, including labor market imbalances associated
with sectoral and demographic shifts.22
22It is worth noting that although development may narrow
income differentials, and so reduce the desire to migrate, the
relaxation of binding credit constraints can itself increase migration
(Clemens and Postel 2018).

CHAPTER 3

Journeys and junctions: Spillovers from migration and refugee policies

Box 3.1. Natural Disasters, Conflict, and Forced Displacement
Forced displacement (see Online Annex 3.1 for
definition) can reflect a complex combination of push
factors. Although conflict remains the primary driver,
climate change and natural disasters can contribute by
aggravating vulnerabilities and inequalities (Berlemann
and Steinhardt 2017; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer 2020;
UNHCR 2024). Forced displacement typically occurs
over short distances—as part of refugees’ search for the
closest viable place to find safety—with the degree of
cross-border displacement often linked to the size of
the affected country (Beltran and Hadzi-Vaskov 2023).
In mid-2024, the stock of forcibly displaced persons
reached a record high of 123 million globally, with
the number of those internally displaced—at just over
half that total—marking its 12th consecutive year
of increase (Figure 3.1.1). Although conflict-driven
movement accounts for most of the stock of displaced
persons, natural disasters have become a key driver of
internal displacement. Indeed, over the past 20 years,
among the nearly 27 million internally displaced persons each year, about two-thirds of these displacements
were triggered by natural disasters.

Conflict and Displacement
Conflict, violence, and persecution have uprooted
millions of people globally. High-intensity conflicts can
result in significant refugee flows from the conflict-affected economy that persist longer than those sparked
by natural disasters (Figure 3.1.2; April 2024 Regional
Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia). With
skilled and educated individuals more likely to flee from
violence, conflicts can also result in a substantial brain
drain (Rother and others 2016). Moreover, because
legal and administrative barriers in destination economies often limit refugees’ access to formal labor markets
and basic services, displacement often pushes many into
low-productivity, low-skill, and informal jobs, curtailing
their contribution to local economies at their destination (Bassanetti, Sacco, and Tieman, forthcoming).

The Intersection of Natural Disasters and
Displacement
Natural disasters can affect land productivity; food,
energy, and water security; and general habitability,
contributing to forced displacement. For instance,
sudden-onset natural disasters (for example, storms and
floods) can lead to destruction of homes and infrastructure and the interruption of basic services, forcing

people to flee. Even absent sudden-onset natural disasters, slower-onset phenomena (for example, sea-level
rises, desertification, sustained decrease in rainfall, and
temperature increases) will progressively erode living
conditions, essential resources, and livelihood opportunities, while triggering displacement, and potentially
driving conflicts over access to resources and weakening
social cohesion (Raleigh 2010; Vesco and others 2020).
At the same time, natural disasters may also reduce
household incomes and resources, thereby limiting people’s ability to migrate (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer 2020).
In Africa, natural disasters in migrants’ and refugees’ countries of origin are positively associated with
migration and refugee flows—often to another African
country. Higher precipitation levels and floods have
been identified as key push factors, with refugee flows
from landlocked African economies also sensitive to
temperature levels and anomalies (Kanga and others
2024). Such findings are corroborated more generally
across emerging market and developing economies—by
contributing to cross-border displacement, natural
disasters drive much of climatic shocks’ impact on
economic outcomes (Beltran and Hadzi-Vaskov 2023;
Figure 3.1.3). Impacts are most prominent in small
states, where internal mobility is limited during natural

effect of natural disasters on migration and refugee

Spillovers from Forced Displacement
Natural disasters and conflict-related shocks often
intersect.1 The precise impact on displacement across
borders will depend on the nature of underlying vulnerabilities—and shocks—and the region in which they
occur (Abel and others 2019).2 What is clear, however,
is that most forced displacement occurs within (and
between) emerging market and developing economies.
Indeed, nearly two-thirds of refugees under the United

and other people in need of international protection
come from just four countries (Afghanistan, Syria,

hosted in emerging market and developing economies,
with half the global total in just 10 such economies.
The concentration of refugees among emerging market and developing destination economies—including
many with limited fiscal capacity—highlights the
challenges caused by poor integration. Evidence
suggests that labor market outcomes of refugees are
significantly worse than those of native populations
and initially tend to generate net fiscal costs (Evans
and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell, Dustmann, and Preston
2020). Recent research on the Middle East, North
Africa, and Central Asia also finds that host countries
often experience higher fiscal deficits following refugee
inflows; the increases are associated with the provision
of health, education, and subsistence services. Better
integration of refugees can therefore help alleviate such
pressures, because better labor market outcomes can
not only help resolve labor shortages but also boost
tax revenues and, more generally, aggregate demand
and GDP growth (Bassanetti, Sacco, and Tieman,
forthcoming).

Box 3.2. The Demographic Dividends from Migration

Migration and the Demographic Match
Globally, migrants and refugees are typically
younger—with a larger proportion of them of working age—than natives (Figure 3.2.1). For instance,
78 percent of migrants and refugees are of working
age, compared with only 63 percent of native populations. Fertility rates of migrants are also higher than
those of natives, providing a longer-term boost to the
working-age population.
Enabling age-based labor market matches through
migration can yield substantial economic gains.
Previous research also finds that immigrants can have

Increased longevity and falling fertility are driving a
secular rise in old-age dependency largely in advanced
economies, but also in maturing emerging market
economies. Advanced economies are projected to see
old-age dependency rise from 20 older people for
every 100 working-age individuals at the turn of the
century to 50 by the end of 2050, an increase that
effectively leaves one person over the age of 65 in the
care of two working-age adults. The shrinking labor
force is not only holding back potential growth (see
the April 2024 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3),
but it is also increasing fiscal strains caused by higher
health-spending needs alongside fewer workers to pay
into pension systems. At the same time, many low-income developing countries are still in the early stages
of demographic transition, experiencing a so-called
youth bulge, with a high proportion of young people
set to enter the workforce. However, challenges
associated with high levels of informality, lack of jobs,
and limited social protection are preventing the full
absorption of these young people into workforces.
This imbalance of labor supply, between youth-poor
and youth-rich countries, can be partly alleviated by
a flow of younger migrants and refugees into aging
countries. Such a global resource reallocation could
simultaneously ease the economic pressures from a
smaller labor force in destination economies and a lack
of opportunities in origin economies. However, these
potential gains in a world of asynchronous aging hinge
on a market-based match between the skills of young
migrants and the youth-intensive comparative advantages of destination economies. Migration policies can
support or hinder the redistribution of young workers
by affecting individuals’ ability to move to countries
where their skills are most needed.

Affairs; and IMF staff calculations.

a positive net fiscal contribution over the medium
term (Orrenius 2017; Clemens 2022)—that is, fiscal
revenue per migrant and refugee exceeds the cost of
public-goods provision, especially when adequate
integration measures are in place. A double dividend
can be also achieved if migration confers gains on
origin economies. This, however, requires productively
absorbing migrants’ excess labor and positive diaspora
spillovers in knowledge transfers and human and physical capital investments linked to remittances inflows,
to offset a negative effect on labor supply (Carare
and others 2024; Fackler, Giesing, and Laurentsyeva
2020; Leblang and Helms 2023; Williams 2024; Prato
2025).

Alignment of Migration Flows with Comparative
Advantage and Demographic Needs
Countries vary in the youth intensity of their
economic activity—the required cognitive and physical
skills, which can depend on age. For instance, certain
sectors require strong physical skills (such as mining and construction) and naturally favor younger
workers. In this context, population aging can have
a disproportionate impact on sectors that require
young workers (Cai and Stoyanov 2016; Gu and
Stoyanov 2019). Skill shortages can emerge, with

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Box 3.2 (continued)
an increased demand for younger workers in sectors
requiring peak physical and cognitive abilities. If
the matching of cross-border labor flows is efficient,
migrants—comprising mainly younger workers—will
be allocated to countries that have a comparative
advantage in youth-intensive sectors.
Local projections using indices of economies’
revealed comparative advantages in youth-dependent industries show that migration patterns broadly
match comparative advantages in destination economies: Migrant workers generally move to countries
where trade is more dependent on youth-related
skills. Indeed, a one-standard-deviation increase in
a country’s comparative advantage with respect to
youth-intensive trade is associated with higher net
migration inflows (Figure 3.2.2).
The overall magnitude of the effect varies with the
age dependency of the destination economy as well as
its migration policies. The response of migration and
refugee inflows to an increase in the youth intensity
of trade is greatest for aging countries, suggesting that
migration is efficiently channeled not only to countries that specialize in youth-intensive trade, but also
to countries likely to face an acute shortage of the
cognitive and physical skills required for their trade.
Furthermore, more restrictive migration policies lower
the elasticity of migration flows to the youth intensity
of trade, potentially hindering the efficient global allocation of labor. In aging economies this could mean
constraints on alleviating youth-related skills shortages,
potentially affecting the structure of these economies’
trade. Such findings are in line with existing literature
that underscores the importance of aligning migration
policies with labor market needs (Ortega and Peri
2013; Platt, Polavieja, and Radl 2022).

Box 3.3. The Impact of Immigration on Government Finances
Although migration holds the promise of alleviating
structural demographic challenges for countries with
aging societies, its overall impact on fiscal outcomes—
including revenues, spending pressures, and overall
debt burdens—can vary and be difficult to determine
with any certainty (Vargas-Silva, Sumption, and
Brindle 2024; Vargas-Silva 2015). This box provides
an overview of some of the main channels and mechanisms at play.
The fiscal impact of immigration will be influenced by the characteristics of a particular destination
economy, the migration pathway used, migrants’ age
profile, the degree of complementarity of their skills
with those of natives, and investment needs to ease
public services congestion.
In advanced economies, evidence exists that
migrants and refugees have on average a more favorable net fiscal impact than that of natives (Sallam
and Christl 2024; UK OBR 2024). Such findings
are linked to typical age profiles—with working-age
immigrants providing a more positive fiscal boost to
destination economies than those outside of working age (de Matos 2021) and evidence that a higher
proportion of migrants are of working age than in
the native population (Box 3.2). Similarly, the fiscal
contributions of some economic migrants are on
average greater than those of other immigrants (van
de Beek and others 2024). Likewise, migrants who are
highly educated (or more highly paid) and relatively
young can place substantial downward pressure on
budget deficits over their lifetimes, whereas migrants
with fewer qualifications (or who are relatively lower
paid) and older may induce net fiscal costs (Di
Martino 2024; UK OBR 2024; Figure 3.3.1). Taken
together, this implies that positive contributions
of some migrants may be partly offset by negative
contributions of others (Rowthorn 2008). But once
capital taxes paid by employers of immigrant labor are
taken into consideration, the benefits of working-age
immigrants for fiscal outturns may be positive, even
those for immigrants who do not have a high school
education (Clemens 2022). Furthermore, if migrants
do not make claims on government expenditure in
old age, then net lifetime benefits to their destination
economies may be enhanced (Rowthorn 2008).
Investment and labor market integration challenges may be more pertinent for some emerging
market and developing economies because of broader

institutional-capacity constraints. Furthermore, these
economies are often the largest recipients of refugee
flows, which—if they are large and unexpected—
can result in more acute integration challenges and
skills mismatches (Evans and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell,
Dustmann, and Preston 2020). Indeed, even in regard
to advanced economies there is evidence that refugees have lower labor force participation rates than
migrants (Figure 3.3.2). Cultural, legal, and structural
barriers can also drive refugees into informal employment with relatively lower fiscal benefits than those
in the formal sector. The combined result of such
challenges is to constrain the potential fiscal benefits
from hosting migrants and refugees—indeed, the
short-term fiscal costs of hosting refugees are sizable in

Outlook, Chapter 4). At the same time, overcoming
constraints on the full economic participation of
refugees could lower costs of assistance in low- and
middle-income countries by about 75 percent (World
Bank and UNHCR 2024).
The capacity to adapt to migrants and refugees
and fully integrate them into the workforce is also

94

important in determining how quickly economies
may benefit from higher labor income tax revenues
and increasing returns to capital. Where impediments
to business investment (and to capital accumulation)
exist, the full benefits from an increase in the supply
of labor may be delayed (Caliendo and others 2023).
Furthermore, where integration challenges exist,
congestion effects including increased demand for
public services and infrastructure—for instance, access
to health care and housing—may (at least temporarily)
place strains on public finances.
Across generations, immigration may provide more
pronounced benefits as first-generation immigrants
better integrate into destination economies, capital
adjusts, and subsequent generations contribute to
labor force growth, economic activity, productivity,
and higher tax revenues (Sultanov 2021).1 Sustained
economic growth from enhanced productivity,
combined with larger revenue streams, can improve
fiscal outcomes and, ultimately, the sustainability of
public finances. At the same time, descendants of
immigrants generally tend to have more favorable net
fiscal impacts, reflecting slightly higher educational
achievements and higher wages and salaries (Blau and
Mackie 2017).

1Indeed, projections by the US Congressional Budget Office
estimate that a multiyear wave of 6 million immigrants would
reduce the US federal deficit by $0.9 trillion by 2034 (US CBO
2024). The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has projected
that an increase in annual net migration from 129,000 to
245,000 arrivals would reduce public debt as a share of GDP by
30 percentage points (UK OBR 2023).

Box 3.4. Immigration and Inflation
The relationship between migration and inflation is
complex. Larger migration flows can do the following:
• Increase labor supply, by placing downward pressure
on wages, and therefore inflation. Such increases
may vary depending on the speed of integration of
migrants into labor markets and existing economic
and labor market conditions. With migrants
often being more mobile and more willing to take
low-paying jobs than natives, migration can even
cause structural shifts in the relationship between
inflation and unemployment (Bentolila, Dolado,
and Jimeno 2008).
• Increase the demand for goods and services, as they
contribute to local consumption following arrival.
This can stimulate demand for goods and services
and exert upward pressure on inflation in the short
term, if the supply of goods and services is inelastic.
Inflationary dynamics may also vary with complementarities between capital and labor. For instance,
stronger complementarity would mean that an expansion in the workforce from migration can enhance
capital returns, subsequently boosting investment.
If the capital stock is slow to adjust, the initial
investment surge may outpace increases in output,
generating an inflationary response. Such investment
effects may be muted if the complementarity between
migrants and capital is lower—particularly relevant
where migrants are low-skilled or their skills are poorly
matched to labor market needs in destination economies (Cheremukhin and others 2024). These effects
can be smaller when capital in a destination economy
is not used at full capacity.
Model simulations across a range of countries
highlight how these different channels can alter the
inflationary implications of migration surges. With
capital able to adjust, a surge in high-skilled migration of about 0.7 percent of the population1 triggers
a boost in investment, such that demand effects
dominate and inflation increases up to 0.25 percentage
The author of this box is Samuel Mann.
1In line with the case in Cheremukhin and others (2024), this
shock roughly corresponds to the postpandemic immigration
surge seen in the United States.

point within three years of the shock (Figure 3.4.1;
Online Annex 3.4). In contrast, a similar surge in lowskilled migration has very little impact on inflation.
Despite the inflationary effects of stronger aggregate
consumption demand from a larger population, these
are offset by the disinflationary effects of greater labor
supply and muted investment from the assumption of
limited complementarity between low-skilled migrant
labor and capital.2
Migration inflows can also have varying effects on
wages of natives, migrants, and refugees, depending
2More generally, modifications to variables such as the wage
skill premium, capital income share, and population growth rates
yield similar qualitative outcomes, affirming that Cheremukhin
and others’ (2024) results for the United States are applicable in
a broader context.

on their skill levels when joining the workforce. Given
complementarity between low-skilled and high-skilled
labor, model simulations suggest that a surge in lowskilled immigration tends to marginally increase the
wages of high-skilled native workers as their marginal
productivity increases (Figure 3.4.2). In contrast,
wages for low-skilled native workers decrease slightly—
by less than 1 percentage point over the long term—as
their marginal productivity declines. In comparison,
greater levels of high-skilled migration have the opposite effect, with a marginal decrease in the wages of
high-skilled native workers—by up to 1.5 percentage
points—and a slight increase in wages of low-skilled
native workers over the long term (Figure 3.4.2).
The instances of downward pressure on wages
for natives with skills matching those of migrants
suggested by these simulations are modest and may be
dampened further in practice because of labor market
frictions. For instance, downward nominal wage rigidities, the fact that low-skilled migrants are unlikely to
be perfect substitutes for low-skilled natives (Clemens
and Lewis 2022), and migrant integration challenges
can attenuate such pressures. The existing literature
also finds only very small effects of migration surges
on native employment and wages (Card 1990), and
different effects of such migration surges on subgroups
of the native workforce (Borjas 2015).
Although at the aggregate level, migration can
have a muted effect on wages and inflation, there can
still be significant effects on subcomponents of the
consumer goods basket and local prices. For instance,
in the United States, higher rates of immigration are
found to lower local goods inflation, but to increase
local housing and utilities inflation (Barrett and Tan
2025).

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

T

he Statistical Appendix presents historical
data as well as projections. It comprises eight
sections: Assumptions, What’s New, Data
and Conventions, Country Notes, Classification of Economies, General Features and Composition
of Groups in the World Economic Outlook Classification, Key Data Documentation, and Statistical Tables.
The first section summarizes the assumptions
underlying the estimates and projections for 2025–26.
The second section briefly describes the changes to the
database and statistical tables since the October 2024
World Economic Outlook (WEO). The third section
offers a general description of the data and the conventions used for calculating country group composites.
The fourth section presents selected key information
for each country. The fifth section summarizes the classification of economies in the various groups presented
in the WEO, and the sixth section explains that classification in further detail. The seventh section provides
information on methods and reporting standards for
the member countries’ national account and government finance indicators included in the report.
The last, and main, section comprises the statistical tables. Statistical Appendix A is included here;
Statistical Appendix B is available online at www.imf.
org/en/Publications/WEO.
Data in these tables have been compiled on the basis
of information available through April 14, 2025, but
may not reflect the latest published data in all cases. For
the date of the last data update for each economy, please
refer to the notes provided in the online WEO database. Some economies have revised projections based on
developments in commodity markets and international
trade as of April 4, 2025; these economies are listed in
Box A2. The figures for 2025–26 are shown with the
same degree of precision as the historical figures solely
for convenience; because they are projections, the same
degree of accuracy is not to be inferred.

Assumptions
Real effective exchange rates for the advanced economies are assumed to remain constant at their average
levels measured during March 6, 2025–April 3, 2025.

For 2025 and 2026 these assumptions imply average
US dollar–special drawing right conversion rates of
1.328 and 1.336, US dollar–euro conversion rates1 of
1.077 and 1.083, and yen–US dollar conversion rates
of 149.2 and 146.1, respectively.
It is assumed that the price of oil will average $66.94
a barrel in 2025 and $62.38 a barrel in 2026.
National authorities’ established policies are assumed
to be maintained. Box A1 describes the more specific
policy assumptions underlying the projections for
selected economies.
With regard to interest rates, it is assumed that the
three-month government bond yield for the United States
will average 4.2 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in
2026, that for the euro area will average 2.2 percent in
2025 and 2.1 percent in 2026, and that for Japan will
average 0.5 percent in 2025 and 0.8 percent in 2026.
Further it is assumed that the 10-year government bond
yield for the United States will average 4.2 percent in
2025 and 3.8 percent in 2026, that for the euro area
will average 2.6 percent in 2025 and 2.7 percent in
2026, and that for Japan will average 1.4 percent in
2025 and 1.6 percent in 2026.

What’s New
• For Bolivia, projections for 2027–30 have been
omitted because of significant uncertainty regarding
the economic outlook.
• For Ecuador, fiscal projections for 2025–30 are
excluded from publication because of ongoing
program discussions.

Data and Conventions
Data and projections for 196 economies form the
statistical basis of the WEO database. The data are
maintained jointly by the IMF’s Research Department
1In regard to the introduction of the euro, on December 31, 1998, the

Council of the European Union decided that, effective January 1, 1999,
the irrevocably fixed conversion rates between the euro and currencies
of the member countries adopting the euro are as described in Box 5.4
of the October 1998 WEO. See that box as well for details on how the
conversion rates were established. For the most recent table of fixed conversion rates, see the Statistical Appendix of the April 2023 WEO.

and regional departments, with the latter regularly
updating country projections based on consistent
global assumptions.
Although national statistical agencies are the
ultimate providers of historical data and definitions,
international organizations are also involved in statistical issues, with the objective of harmonizing methodologies for the compilation of national statistics,
including analytical frameworks, concepts, definitions,
classifications, and valuation procedures used in the
production of economic statistics. The WEO database
reflects information from both national source agencies
and international organizations.
Most countries’ macroeconomic data as presented
in the WEO conform broadly to the 2008 version
of the System of National Accounts (SNA 2008). The
IMF’s sector statistical standards—the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6), the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and Compilation Guide, and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM
2014)—have been aligned with the SNA 2008. These
standards reflect the IMF’s special interest in countries’
external positions, monetary developments, financial
sector stability, and public sector fiscal positions. The
process of adapting country data to the new standards
begins in earnest when revised versions of the manuals
are released. However, full concordance with the most
recent versions of the manuals is ultimately dependent
on the provision by national statistical compilers of
revised country data; hence, the WEO estimates are
only partly adapted to the most recent versions of these
manuals. Nonetheless, for many countries, conversion
to the updated standards will have only a small impact
on major balances and aggregates. Many other countries have partly adopted the latest standards and will
continue implementation over a number of years.2
The fiscal gross and net debt data reported in the
WEO are drawn from official data sources and IMF
staff estimates. While attempts are made to align data
on gross and net debt with the definitions in the
GFSM 2014, as a result of data limitations or specific
country circumstances, these data can sometimes deviate from the formal definitions. Although every effort
2Many countries are implementing the SNA 2008 or European

System of National and Regional Accounts 2010, and a few countries use versions of the SNA older than that from 1993. A similar
adoption pattern is expected for the BPM6 and GFSM 2014. Please
refer to Table G, which lists the statistical standards to which each
country adheres.

102

is made to ensure the WEO data are relevant and
internationally comparable, differences in both sectoral
and instrument coverage mean that the data are not
universally comparable. As more information becomes
available, changes in either data sources or instrument
coverage can give rise to data revisions that are sometimes substantial. For clarification on the deviations
in sectoral or instrument coverage, please refer to the
metadata for the online WEO database.
Composite data for country groups in the WEO are
either sums or weighted averages of data for individual
countries. Unless noted otherwise, multiyear averages
of growth rates are expressed as compound annual rates
of change.3 Arithmetically weighted averages are used
for all data for the emerging market and developing
economies group—except data on inflation and money
growth, for which geometric averages are used. The
following conventions apply:
Country group composites for exchange rates, interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are
weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market
exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three
years) as a share of group GDP.
Composites for other data relating to the domestic
economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parity as a share
of total world or group GDP.4 For the aggregation
of inflation in advanced economies (and subgroups),
annual rates are simple percent changes from the
previous years; for the aggregation of world inflation
and inflation in emerging market and developing
economies (and subgroups), annual rates are based on
logarithmic differences.
Composites for real GDP per capita in purchasing-­
power-parity terms are sums of individual country data
after conversion to international dollars in the years
indicated.

3Averages for real GDP, inflation, GDP per capita, and com-

modity prices are calculated based on the compound annual rate of
change, except in the case of the unemployment rate, which is based
on the simple arithmetic average.
4See Box A2 in the Statistical Appendix of the October 2024 WEO
for a summary of the revised purchasing-power-parity-based weights
as well as Box 1.1 of the October 2020 WEO, “Revised Purchasing
Power Parity Weights” in the July 2014 WEO Update, Appendix 1.1
of the April 2008 WEO, Box A2 of the April 2004 WEO, Box A1 of
the May 2000 WEO, and Annex IV of the May 1993 WEO. See also
Anne-Marie Gulde and Marianne Schulze-Ghattas, “Purchasing Power
Parity Based Weights for the World Economic Outlook,” in Staff Studies
for the World Economic Outlook (Washington, DC: International
Monetary Fund, December 1993), 106–23.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors
for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in transactions within the area. Unadjusted annual
GDP data are used for the euro area and for the majority of individual countries, except Cyprus, Ireland,
Portugal, and Spain, which report calendar-adjusted
data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply
1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual
country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
Composite unemployment rates and employment
growth are weighted by labor force as a share of group
labor force.
Composites relating to external sector statistics are
sums of individual country data after conversion to
US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the
years indicated for balance of payments data and at
end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes
and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percent
changes for individual countries weighted by the US
dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total
world or group exports or imports (in the preceding
year).
Unless noted otherwise, group composites are
computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group
weights is represented.
Data refer to calendar years, except in the case of
a few countries that use fiscal years; Table F lists the
economies with exceptional reporting periods for
national accounts and government finance data.
For some countries, the figures for 2024 and earlier
are based on estimates rather than actual outturns;
Table G lists the date of the latest actual outturns for
the indicators in the national accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments for each
country.

Country Notes
Afghanistan: Data for 2021–23 are reported for
selected indicators, with estimates for fiscal data. Estimates and projections for 2024–30 are omitted because
of an unusually high degree of uncertainty given that
the IMF has paused its engagement with Afghanistan
owing to a lack of clarity within the international
community regarding the recognition of a government
in the country. Data reported in the WEO contain a

structural break in 2021 as a result of the change from
calendar year to solar year reporting; the actual reported
GDP growth rate for solar year 2021 is –20.7 percent.
Algeria: Total government expenditure and net
lending/borrowing include net lending by the government, which mostly reflects support to the pension
system and other public sector entities.
Argentina: The official national consumer price index
(CPI) starts in December 2016. For earlier periods,
CPI data for Argentina reflect the Greater Buenos Aires
Area CPI (prior to December 2013); the national CPI
(IPCNu, December 2013 to October 2015); the City
of Buenos Aires CPI (November 2015 to April 2016);
and the Greater Buenos Aires Area CPI (May 2016 to
December 2016). Given limited comparability of these
series because of differences in geographic coverage,
weights, sampling, and methodology, the WEO does
not report average CPI inflation for 2014–16 and endof-period inflation for 2015–16. Also, Argentina discontinued the publication of labor market data starting
in the fourth quarter of 2015, and new series became
available starting in the second quarter of 2016.
Bolivia: Projections for 2027–30 have been omitted
because of significant uncertainty regarding the economic outlook.
Costa Rica: The central government definition was
expanded as of January 1, 2021, to include 51 public
entities in accordance with Law 9524. Data back to
2019 are adjusted for comparability.
Dominican Republic: The fiscal series have the
following coverage: Public debt, debt service, and
the cyclically adjusted/structural balances are for the
consolidated public sector (which includes the central
government, the rest of the nonfinancial public sector,
and the central bank); the remaining fiscal series are for
the central government.
Ecuador: Fiscal projections for 2025–30 are excluded
from publication because of ongoing program
discussions.
Eritrea: Data and projections for 2020–30 are
excluded from the database because of constraints in
data reporting.
India: Real GDP growth rates are calculated in accordance with national accounts with base year 2011/12.
Iran: Historical figures for nominal GDP in US
dollars are computed using the official exchange rate
up to 2017. From 2018 onward, the NIMA (the
country’s domestic Forex Management Integrated
System) exchange rate, rather than the official exchange
rate, is used to convert nominal rial GDP figures into

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

103

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

US dollars. The IMF staff assesses that the NIMA rate
better reflects the transaction-value-weighted exchange
rate in the economy over that period of time.
Israel: Projections are subject to heightened uncertainty owing to the conflict in the region and thus may
undergo revisions.
Lebanon: Fiscal and national accounts data for
2022–24 as well as debt data for 2023–24 are IMF staff
estimates and not provided by the national authorities.
Estimates and projections for 2025–30 are omitted
owing to an unusually high degree of uncertainty.
Sierra Leone: Although the currency was redenominated on July 1, 2022, local currency data are expressed
in the old leone for the April 2025 WEO.
Sri Lanka: Data and projections for 2025–30 are
excluded from publication owing to ongoing discussions on restructuring of sovereign debt.
Sudan: Projections reflect the IMF staff ’s analysis
based on the assumption that the ongoing conflict will
terminate by the end of 2025 and that reengagement
and reconstruction will commence shortly thereafter.
Data for 2011 exclude South Sudan after July 9; data
for 2012 and onward pertain to the current Sudan.
Syria: Data are excluded from 2011 onward because
of the uncertain political situation.
Timor-Leste: Published data for real GDP refer to
non-oil real GDP, while published data for nominal
GDP refer to total nominal GDP.
Turkmenistan: Real GDP data are IMF staff estimates
compiled in line with international methodologies
(SNA), using official estimates and sources as well as
United Nations and World Bank databases. Estimates
of and projections for the fiscal balance exclude receipts
from domestic bond issuances as well as privatization
operations, in line with the GFSM 2014. The authorities’ official estimates for fiscal accounts, which are
compiled using domestic statistical methodologies,
include bond issuance and privatization proceeds as
part of government revenues.
Ukraine: Revised data for national accounts are
available for 2000 onward and exclude Crimea and
Sevastopol from 2010 onward.
Uruguay: In December 2020 the authorities began
reporting national accounts data according to the SNA
2008, with base year 2016. The new series begin in
2016. Data prior to 2016 reflect the IMF staff ’s best
effort to preserve previously reported data and avoid
structural breaks.
Starting in October 2018 Uruguay’s public pension
system received transfers in the context of Law 19,590
of 2017, which compensates persons affected by the
104

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

creation of the country’s mixed pension system. These
funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with the
IMF’s methodology. Therefore, data for 2018–22 are
affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 1.0 percent of GDP in 2019,
0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, 0.3 percent of GDP in
2021, 0.1 percent of GDP in 2022, and 0 percent
thereafter. See IMF Country Report 19/64 for further details.5 The disclaimer about the public pension
system applies only to the revenues and net lending/
borrowing series.
The coverage of the fiscal data for Uruguay was
changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector with the October 2019 WEO. In
Uruguay, nonfinancial public sector coverage includes
the central government, local government, social security funds, nonfinancial public corporations, and Banco
de Seguros del Estado. Historical data were also revised
accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter—
which excludes the central bank—assets and liabilities
held by the nonfinancial public sector for which the
counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in
debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued
in the past by the government to the central bank are
now part of the nonfinancial public sector debt.
Venezuela: Projecting the economic outlook, including assessing past and current economic developments
used as the basis for the projections, is rendered
difficult by the lack of discussions with the authorities
(the most recent Article IV consultation took place
in 2004), incomplete metadata for limited reported
statistics, and difficulties in reconciling reported indicators with economic developments. The fiscal accounts
include the budgetary central government; social
security; FOGADE (the country’s deposit insurance
institution); and a reduced set of public enterprises,
including Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. Following some
methodological upgrades to achieve a more robust
nominal GDP, historical data and indicators expressed
as a percentage of GDP have been revised from 2012
onward. For most indicators, data for 2018–24 are IMF
staff estimates. The effects of hyperinflation, the paucity
of reported data, and uncertainty mean that the IMF
staff ’s estimated and projected macroeconomic indicators should be interpreted with caution. Venezuela’s
consumer prices are excluded from all WEO group
composites.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

West Bank and Gaza: Estimates and projections for
2024–30 are excluded from publication owing to the
unusually high degree of uncertainty. The latest actual
annual data for consumer prices are for 2024. Annual
data for the unemployment rate are available up to 2022.
Zimbabwe: The Zimbabwe authorities have recently
redenominated their national accounts statistics following the introduction on April 5, 2024, of a new
national currency, the Zimbabwe gold, replacing the
Zimbabwe dollar. The use of the Zimbabwe dollar
ceased on April 30, 2024.

Classification of Economies
Summary of the Economy Classification
The economy classification in the WEO divides the
world into two major groups: advanced economies
and emerging market and developing economies.6 This
classification is not based on strict criteria, economic
or otherwise, and has evolved over time. The objective
is to facilitate analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful method of organizing data. Table A provides an
overview of the classification, showing the number of
economies in each group by region and summarizing
some key indicators of their relative size (GDP valued
at purchasing power parity, total exports of goods and
services, and population).
Some economies remain outside the classification
and therefore are not included in the analysis. Cuba
and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are
examples of economies that are not IMF members, and
the IMF therefore does not monitor them.

General Features and Composition of
Groups in the World Economic Outlook
Classification
Advanced Economies
Table B lists the 41 advanced economies. The seven
largest in terms of GDP based on market exchange
rates—the United States, Japan, Germany, France,
Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada—constitute
the subgroup of major advanced economies, often
referred to as the Group of Seven. The members of
the euro area are also distinguished as a subgroup.
6As used here, the terms “country” and “economy” do not always
refer to a territorial entity that is a state as understood by international law and practice. Some territorial entities included here are
not states, although their statistical data are maintained on a separate
and independent basis.

Composite data shown in the tables for the euro area
cover the current members for all years, even though
the membership has increased over time.
Table C lists the member countries of the European
Union, not all of which are classified as advanced
economies in the WEO.

Emerging Market and Developing Economies
The group of emerging market and developing
economies (155) comprises all those that are not classified as advanced economies.
The regional breakdowns of emerging market and
developing economies employed in the WEO are
emerging and developing Asia; emerging and developing Europe (sometimes also referred to as “central and
eastern Europe”); Latin America and the Caribbean;
Middle East and Central Asia (which comprises the
regional subgroups Caucasus and Central Asia; and
Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan);
and sub-Saharan Africa.
Emerging market and developing economies are also
classified according to analytical criteria that reflect
the composition of export earnings and a distinction between net creditor and net debtor economies.
Tables D and E show the detailed composition of
emerging market and developing economies in the
regional and analytical groups.
The analytical criterion source of export earnings
distinguishes between the categories fuel (Standard
International Trade Classification [SITC] 3) and
nonfuel and then focuses on nonfuel primary products
(SITCs 0, 1, 2, 4, and 68). Economies are categorized
into one of these groups if their main source of export
earnings exceeded 50 percent of total exports on average between 2019 and 2023.
The financial and income criteria focus on net
creditor economies, net debtor economies, heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs), low-income developing countries (LIDCs), and emerging market and middle-income
economies (EMMIEs). Economies are categorized as net
debtors when their latest net international investment
position, where available, was less than zero or their
current account balance accumulations from 1972
(or earliest available data) to 2023 were negative. Net
debtor economies are further differentiated on the basis
of experience with debt servicing.7
7During 2019–23, 43 economies incurred external payments
arrears or entered into official or commercial bank debt-rescheduling
agreements. This group is referred to as economies with arrears and/or
rescheduling during 2019–23.

The HIPC group comprises the countries that
are or have been considered by the IMF and the
World Bank for participation in their debt initiative known as the HIPC Initiative, which aims to
reduce the external debt burdens of all the eligible
HIPCs to a “sustainable” level in a reasonably short
period of time.8 Many of these countries have already
8See David Andrews, Anthony R. Boote, Syed S. Rizavi, and
Sukwinder Singh, “Debt Relief for Low-Income Countries: The
Enhanced HIPC Initiative,” IMF Pamphlet Series 51 (Washington,
DC: International Monetary Fund, November 1999).

benefited from debt relief and have graduated from
the initiative.
The LIDCs are countries that have per capita
income levels below a certain threshold (based on
$2,700 in 2017 as measured by the World Bank’s Atlas
method and updated following new information in
early 2024), structural features consistent with limited
development and structural transformation, and external financial linkages insufficiently close for them to be
widely seen as emerging market economies.
The EMMIEs are those emerging market and developing economies not classified as LIDCs.

data are included in the group aggregates.
2 Syria and West Bank and Gaza are omitted from group composites for source of export earnings, and Syria is omitted from group composites for net external
position, because of insufficient data. Syria is not included in Emerging Market and Middle-Income Economies or Low-Income Developing Countries.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1. Economic Policy Assumptions underlying the Projections for
Selected Economies
Fiscal Policy Assumptions
The short-term fiscal policy assumptions used in
the World Economic Outlook (WEO) are normally
based on officially announced budgets, adjusted for
differences between the national authorities and the
IMF staff regarding macroeconomic assumptions
and projected fiscal outturns. When no official budget has been announced, projections incorporate
policy measures judged likely to be implemented.
The medium-term fiscal projections are similarly
based on a judgment about policies’ most likely
path. For cases in which the IMF staff has insufficient information to assess the authorities’ budget
intentions and prospects for policy implementation,
an unchanged structural primary balance is assumed
unless indicated otherwise. Specific assumptions
used in regard to selected economies follow. (See
also Tables B5 through B9 in the online section
of the Statistical Appendix for data on fiscal net
lending/borrowing and structural balances.)1
Argentina: Fiscal projections are based on the
available information regarding budget outturn,
budget plans, and IMF-supported program targets
for the federal government; on fiscal measures
announced by the authorities; and on IMF staff
macroeconomic projections.
Australia: Fiscal projections are based on data
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the
FY2025/26 budgets published by the Commonwealth Government and the FY2024/25 budgets published by the respective state/territory

1The output gap is actual minus potential output, as a
percentage of potential output. Structural balances are expressed
as a percentage of potential output. The structural balance is the
actual net lending/borrowing minus the effects of cyclical output
from potential output, corrected for one-time and other factors,
such as asset and commodity prices and output composition
effects. Changes in the structural balance consequently include
effects of temporary fiscal measures, the impact of fluctuations in
interest rates and debt-service costs, and other noncyclical fluctuations in net lending/borrowing. The computations of structural
balances are based on the IMF staff ’s estimates of potential GDP
and revenue and expenditure elasticities. (See Annex I of the
October 1993 World Economic Outlook.) Estimates of the output
gap and of the structural balance are subject to significant margins of uncertainty. Net debt is calculated as gross debt minus
financial assets corresponding to debt instruments.

governments, and the IMF staff ’s estimates and
projections.
Austria: IMF staff fiscal projections are based on
the authorities’ latest medium-term plans, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff ’s macroeconomic assumptions and assuming some moderate expenditure
restraint over the medium term in line with historical patterns.
Belgium: Projections are based on the 2024
Budgetary Plan, the Belgian Monitoring Committee’s reports, and other available information on the
authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the
IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Brazil: Fiscal projections reflect current and
expected policies.
Canada: Projections use the baseline forecasts
from the Government of Canada’s 2024 Fall Economic Statement and the latest provincial budget
updates. IMF staff make some adjustments to
these forecasts, including those for differences in
macroeconomic projections. IMF staff ’s forecast
also incorporates the most recent data releases from
Statistics Canada’s National Economic Accounts,
including quarterly federal, provincial, and territorial budgetary outturns.
Chile: Fiscal projections are based on the authorities’ budget projections, adjusted to reflect the IMF
staff ’s macroeconomic projections.
China: Staff fiscal projections incorporate the
2025 budget as well as estimates of off-budget
financing.
Colombia: Fiscal projections are based on the
authorities’ policies and projections reflected
in the 2025 Financing Plan and the 2024–35
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, adjusted to reflect
IMF staff ’s macroeconomic assumptions. The 2025
central government overall balance reflects the
Financing Plan published in February.
Denmark: Estimates for the current year are
aligned with the latest official budget numbers,
adjusted where appropriate for the IMF staff ’s
macroeconomic assumptions. Beyond the current
year, the projections incorporate key features of
the medium-term fiscal plan as embodied in the
authorities’ latest budget. Structural balances are
net of temporary fluctuations in some revenues

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

123

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Box A1 (continued)
(for example, North Sea revenue, pension yield tax
revenue) and one-offs (COVID-19–related one-offs
are, however, included).
France: Projections for 2025 onward are based on
the 2025 budget, multiannual budget programming
bill 2023–27, and other available information on
the authorities’ fiscal plans, adjusted for differences
in revenue projections and assumptions on macroeconomic and financial variables.
Germany: Fiscal projections are based on the
IMF staff ’s macroeconomic framework and assume
a gradual increase in infrastructure and defense
spending over the medium term, in line with the
authorities’ stated intentions. The projections also
assume the use of additional fiscal room generated
by reforms to Germany’s fiscal rule (the “debt
brake”) in March 2025.
Greece: Data since 2010 reflect adjustments in
line with the primary balance definition under the
enhanced surveillance framework for Greece.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region:
Projections are based on the authorities’
medium-term fiscal projections for expenditures.
Hungary: Fiscal projections include the IMF staff ’s
projections for the macroeconomic framework and
fiscal policy plans announced in the 2025 budget.
India: Projections are based on available information on the authorities’ fiscal plans, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions. General
government data cover only central and state governments. State government data are incorporated
with a lag of up to one year; general government
data are thus finalized well after central government
data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction
proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in
certain minor categories, and some public sector
lending. Starting with FY2020/21 data, expenditure
also includes the off-budget component of food
subsidies, consistent with the revised treatment of
food subsidies in the budget. The IMF staff adjusts
expenditure to take out payments for previous years’
food subsidies, which are included as expenditure in
budget estimates for FY2020/21.
Indonesia: The IMF staff ’s projections are based
on the latest budget, extrapolating using projected

124

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

nominal GDP (and its components as needed) with
application of judgment to reflect the authorities’
spending and revenue policies over the medium
term.
Ireland: Fiscal projections are based on the country’s Budget 2025.
Israel: Projections are subject to significant risks
given the unpredictability of the conflict and its
impact on the economy. Fiscal projections are for
the general government and take the 2025 budget
into account.
Italy: The IMF staff ’s estimates and projections
are informed by the fiscal plans included in the
government’s medium-term fiscal–structural plan
for 2025–29 and the updated national accounts.
The stock of maturing postal bonds is included in
the debt projections.
Japan: The projections reflect fiscal measures the
government has already announced, with adjustments for the IMF staff ’s assumptions.
Korea: The forecast incorporates authorities’
annual budget, any supplementary budget, any
proposed new budget, the medium-term fiscal plan,
and the IMF staff ’s estimates.
Mexico: The 2020 public sector borrowing
requirements estimated by the IMF staff adjust for
some statistical discrepancies between above-the-line
and below-the-line numbers. Fiscal projections for
2025 are informed by the estimates in Pre-Criterios
2025; projections for 2025 onward assume continued compliance with rules established in the Federal
Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law.
The Netherlands: Fiscal projections for 2024–30
are based on the IMF staff ’s forecast framework and
are also informed by the authorities’ 2025 budget,
the new government’s coalition agreement, and
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projections.
New Zealand: Fiscal projections are based on the
Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2024 and
Budget Policy Statement 2025.
Portugal: The projections for the current year are
based on the authorities’ approved budget, adjusted
to reflect the IMF staff ’s macroeconomic forecast.
Projections thereafter are based on the assumption
of unchanged policies. Projections for 2025 reflect
information available in the 2025 budget proposal.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX

Box A1 (continued)
Puerto Rico: Fiscal projections are informed by
the Certified Fiscal Plan for the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, which was prepared in October
2024 and certified by the Financial Oversight and
Management Board.
Russia: The fiscal rule was suspended in March
2022 by the government in response to the
sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine,
allowing for windfall oil and gas revenues above
benchmark to be used to finance a larger deficit in
2022 as well as savings accumulated in the National
Welfare Fund. The 2023–25 budget was based on
a modified rule with a two-year transition period
that set the benchmark oil and gas revenues fixed
in rubles at Rub 8 trillion, compared with a fixed
benchmark oil price at $40 a barrel under the 2019
fiscal rule. During the transition period higher deficits than prescribed by the rule were allowed, with
additional financing coming from windfall revenues
saved earlier. However, in late September 2023, the
Ministry of Finance proposed reverting to the earlier version of the fiscal rule from 2024 onward to
determine the price of oil and gas revenues but sets
the benchmark oil price at $60 a barrel. The new
rule, effective in the 2025 budget, allows for higher
oil and gas revenues to be spent, but it simultaneously targets a smaller primary structural deficit.
Saudi Arabia: The IMF staff ’s reference fiscal
projections are based primarily on its understanding of government policies as outlined in the
2025 budget and recent official announcements.
Export oil revenues are based on WEO reference
oil price assumptions and the IMF staff ’s understanding of oil production adjustments under the
OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries, including Russia and other non-OPEC
oil exporters) agreement and those unilaterally
announced by Saudi Arabia.
Singapore: FY2024 projections are based on
revised figures based on budget execution through
the end of 2024. FY2025 projections are based on
the initial budget of February 18, 2025.
South Africa: Fiscal assumptions are informed
by the 2024 budget—complemented by the 2024
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and information from the 2025 budget proposal. Nontax

revenue excludes transactions in financial assets
and liabilities, as they involve primarily revenues
associated with the realized exchange rate valuation
gains from the holding of foreign currency deposits,
sale of assets, and conceptually similar items. The
Eskom debt relief is treated as a capital transfer
above-the-line item.
Spain: Figures for 2021–28 reflect disbursements
of grants and loans under the EU Recovery and
Resilience Facility.
Sweden: Fiscal estimates for 2024 are based on
the authorities’ budget bill and have been updated
with the authorities’ latest interim forecast. The
impact of cyclical developments on the fiscal
accounts is calculated using the 2014 OECD study
to take into account output gap.
Switzerland: The projections assume that fiscal
policy is adjusted as necessary to keep fiscal balances in line with the requirements of Switzerland’s
fiscal rules.
Türkiye: The basis for the projections is the
IMF-defined fiscal balance, which excludes some
revenue and expenditure items that are included in
the authorities’ headline balance.
United Kingdom: Fiscal projections are based
on the October 2024 forecast from the Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the January 2025
release on public sector finances from the Office for
National Statistics. The IMF staff ’ projections take
the OBR forecast as a reference and overlay adjustments for differences in assumptions. The IMF
staff ’s forecasts do not necessarily assume that the
UK fiscal rules will be met at the end of the forecast
period. Data are presented on a calendar year basis.
United States: Fiscal projections are based on the
January 2025 Congressional Budget Office baseline,
adjusted for the IMF staff ’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. Projections incorporate the
effects of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
Monetary Policy Assumptions
Monetary policy assumptions are based on the
established policy framework in each economy. In
most cases, this implies a nonaccommodative stance
over the business cycle: Official interest rates will
increase when economic indicators suggest that

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

125

WORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A Critical Juncture amid Polic y Shifts

Box A1 (continued)
inflation will rise above its acceptable rate or range;
they will decrease when indicators suggest inflation
will not exceed the acceptable rate or range, that
output growth is below its potential rate, and that
the margin of slack in the economy is significant.
With regard to interest rates, please refer to the
Assumptions section at the beginning of the Statistical Appendix.
Argentina: Monetary projections are consistent
with the overall macroeconomic framework, the
fiscal and financing plans, and the monetary and
foreign exchange policies.
Australia: Monetary policy assumptions are
based on the IMF staff ’s analysis and the expected
inflation path.
Brazil: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with the convergence of inflation to target.
Canada: Projections reflect the gradual unwinding of monetary policy tightening by the Bank of
Canada as inflation slowly returns to its mid-range
target of 2 percent by early 2025.
Chile: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with attaining the inflation target.
China: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with inflation gradually rising and the output
gap closing over the medium term.
Denmark: Monetary policy is to maintain the peg
to the euro.
Euro area: Monetary policy assumptions for euro
area member countries are drawn from a suite of
models (semi-structural, DSGE [dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium], Taylor rule), market expectations, and European Central Bank Governing
Council communications.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The
IMF staff assumes that the currency board system
will remain intact.
Hungary: The IMF staff ’s estimates and projections are informed by expert judgment based on
recent developments.
India: Monetary policy projections are consistent
with achieving the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation
target over the medium term.
Indonesia: Monetary policy assumptions are in
line with inflation within the central bank’s target
band over the medium term.

126

International Monetary Fund | April 2025

Israel: Monetary policy assumptions are based on
gradual normalization of monetary policy.
Japan: Monetary policy assumptions for Japan
are based on the IMF staff ’s assessment of the
most likely path for interest rates, considering
the broader macroeconomic outlook, the Bank of
Japan’s communications, and market expectations.
Korea: Projections assume that the policy rate
will evolve in line with the Bank of Korea’s forward
guidance.
Mexico: Monetary policy assumptions are consistent with inflation converging to the central bank’s
target over the projection period.
New Zealand: Monetary projections are based on
the IMF staff ’s analysis and expected inflation path.
Russia: Monetary policy projections assume
that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is
adopting a tight monetary policy stance.
Saudi Arabia: Monetary policy projections are
based on the continuation of the exchange rate peg
to the US dollar.
Singapore: Broad money is projected to grow in
line with the projected growth in nominal GDP.
South Africa: Monetary policy assumptions are
consistent with maintaining inflation within the
3–6 percent target band over the medium term.
Sweden: Monetary policy assumptions are based
on IMF staff ’s estimates.
Switzerland: Monetary policy assumptions are
based on the IMF staff ’s assessment of the most
likely path for interest rates, considering the broader
macroeconomic outlook, the Swiss National Bank’s
inflation forecasts, and market expectations.
Türkiye: The reference projections assume that
the monetary policy stance will remain contractionary in line with announced and observed policies.
United Kingdom: Monetary policy assumptions
for the UK are based on the IMF staff ’s assessment
of the most likely path for interest rates, considering the broader macroeconomic outlook, model
results, the Bank of England’s inflation forecasts
and communications, and market expectations.
United States: The IMF staff expects the Federal
Open Market Committee to continue to adjust the
federal funds target rate in line with the broader
macroeconomic outlook.

values for the relevant individual countries. Some group aggregates for the financial derivatives are not shown because of incomplete data. Projections for the euro area are not available
because of data constraints.
1 Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

Note: The estimates in this table are based on individual countries’ national accounts and balance of payments statistics. Country group composites are calculated as the sum of the US dollar
values for the relevant individual countries. This differs from the calculations in the April 2005 and earlier issues of the World Economic Outlook, in which the composites were weighted
by GDP valued at purchasing power parities as a share of total world GDP. The estimates of gross national savings and investment (or gross capital formation) are from individual countries’
national accounts statistics. The estimates of the current account balance, the capital account balance, and the financial account balance (or net lending/net borrowing) are from the balance of
payments statistics. The link between domestic transactions and transactions with the rest of the world can be expressed as accounting identities. Savings (S) minus investment (I) is equal to
the current account balance (CAB) (S – I = CAB). Also, net lending/net borrowing (NLB) is the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance (KAB) (NLB = CAB + KAB). In
practice, these identities do not hold exactly; imbalances result from imperfections in source data and compilation as well as from asymmetries in group composition due to data availability.
1 Excludes the Group of Seven (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) and euro area countries.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD DISCUSSION OF THE OUTLOOK,
APRIL 2025

The following remarks were made by the Chair at the conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of the
Fiscal Monitor, Global Financial Stability Report, and World Economic Outlook on April 11, 2025.

E

xecutive Directors broadly agreed with
staff ’s assessment of the global economic
outlook, risks, and policy priorities. They
concurred that the global economy is at a
critical juncture, with significant internal and external
imbalances and vulnerabilities. Directors recognized
that major policy shifts are underway, generating a
new wave of uncertainties with potentially significant
implications for the functioning of the global economy.
Directors noted that the financial market landscape
is marked by increased uncertainty and market volatil‑
ity, against the backdrop of stretched valuations within
many segments of financial markets. Global financial
conditions have tightened, with near‑term financial
stability risks (as gauged by IMF’s Growth‑at‑Risk
metric) rising. Directors concurred that further cor‑
rection of asset prices (with geopolitical risks being a
potential trigger), the ongoing increase in leverage and
interconnectedness in the financial system, especially
among certain non‑bank financial intermediaries
(NBFIs) receiving strong investment flows in recent
years, alongside still‑rising sovereign debt levels,
constitute key vulnerabilities keeping risks to financial
stability elevated.
Directors noted that risks to the outlook are
firmly tilted to the downside. They acknowledged
that the escalating protectionism and elevated policy
uncertainty could further reduce near‑ and long‑term
growth at a time when the world economy is
entrenched in a low‑growth, high‑debt environment.
Directors stressed that divergent and rapidly shifting
policy stances or deteriorating sentiment could trigger
more abrupt repricing of assets and sharp adjustments
in foreign exchange rates and capital flows, especially
for emerging market and developing economies. On
the fiscal side, escalating uncertainty and unexpectedly
high interest rates may lead to a significant increase
in global public debt, particularly due to rising

expenditures on defense and declining revenues linked
to output uncertainty from tariffs. Furthermore,
higher interest rates could limit key development
spending and exacerbate financing risks in low‑income
developing countries, including against the background
of declining official development assistance. Directors
also highlighted that more limited international
cooperation on common challenges could also hinder
progress toward building a more resilient global
economy and addressing development needs.
Directors noted that elevated uncertainty intensifies
the growth-inflation trade-offs and called on central
banks to carefully fine-tune monetary policy to
achieve their mandates and ensure price stability.
Monetary policy should remain data‑dependent and
clearly communicated to anchor expectations. Where
near‑term inflation risks are tilted to the upside or
inflation expectations are rising, future cuts to the
policy rate should remain contingent on evidence that
inflation is heading decisively back toward target, while
ensuring that financial stability is not compromised.
Central banks should stand ready to act forcefully if
inflation risks materialize. Directors acknowledged
that although major emerging markets have proved
remarkably resilient in the face of adverse shocks,
abrupt sell offs in global markets against the backdrop
of potential divergence in monetary policy paths,
coupled with high trade policy and economic policy
uncertainty, could tighten their financial conditions
and raise currency volatility. Emerging markets
may thus require adoption of measures to mitigate
disruptive capital outflows, and Directors recognized
that the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework provides
a toolkit for responses in such scenarios, tailored to
country‑specific circumstances.
Directors emphasized that a full, timely and
consistent implementation of Basel III and other
internationally agreed bank regulatory standards would

ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions and
guarantee ample and adequate capital and liquidity.
Directors acknowledged that the growing nexus
between banks and NBFIs calls for supervisors to
enhance the risk assessment of such linkages. They
recognized that continued buildup of debt and
elevated economic uncertainty underscore the need
to strengthen the macroprudential policy framework
to contain excessive risk taking in the NBFI sector,
alongside ensuring capital and liquidity buffers
in banking systems are adequate to support the
provision of credit through periods of stress. Directors
emphasized the importance of macroprudential
buffers and strong crisis preparedness and resolution
frameworks to mitigate shocks.
Directors called for gradual and growth‑friendly
fiscal adjustment within a credible medium‑term
framework to reduce debt, rebuild fiscal buffers, and
accommodate priority spending while protecting the
vulnerable. In light of emerging fiscal risks and new
spending pressures, economies with limited fiscal
space should reprioritize public spending within their
planned budgets. Economies with room for fiscal
maneuver could use some of the available space, if
appropriate, within well‑defined medium‑term fiscal
frameworks. Directors noted that advanced economies
should prioritize expenditure reforms, advance
pension and healthcare reforms, eliminate ineffective
tax incentives, and expand tax bases by removing
exemptions to improve tax expenditure efficiency. For

170

countries facing new spending needs—for example,
in defense—it is essential to demonstrate a strong
commitment to upholding the integrity of the existing
fiscal rules while ensuring transparency. Emerging
market and developing economies should enhance
revenues through tax system reforms and improved
revenue administration, phase out energy subsidies,
and streamline public wage bills while safeguarding
public investment and upgrading social safety nets.
Directors emphasized the need for fiscal and
structural reforms to enhance growth potential and
the criticality of international cooperation to respond
to global challenges and bolster resilience. Given
significant demographic shifts, they stressed the need
for comprehensive policies to increase labor force
participation among women and older workers,
implement pension reforms, and effectively address
migration challenges. Directors recognized that
renewable energy sources and innovative production
paradigms could help countries reap the benefits
of advancements in artificial intelligence without
escalating electricity prices. They also highlighted
that economic activity thrives under clear and
transparent trade policies that stabilize expectations
for businesses and consumers while minimizing
volatility. Furthermore, continued cooperation across
various policy areas—including trade, industrial policy,
international taxation, climate, and development and
humanitarian assistance—can help mitigate global
spillovers and protect vulnerable populations.
